# üß† Pre-PRD Readiness Document  
_For the ‚ÄúAI Onboarding & Workplace Assistant‚Äù (Amazon Bedrock + Google Chat + Lambda)_

## üéØ Objective
Before detailing features and requirements, ensure holistic readiness across product, technical, operational, ethical, and organizational dimensions.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Definition & Scope
- [ ] What exact business pain points are we solving first (onboarding, IT helpdesk, HR FAQ, etc.)?
- [ ] Who are the **primary users** (new employees, HR team, IT support, managers)?
- [ ] What metrics define success?  
  e.g., onboarding completion time ‚Üì 40%, IT ticket volume ‚Üì 25%, CSAT > 4.5 / 5.
- [ ] Which parts of onboarding are **informational** vs. **actionable**?
- [ ] Which user personas require personalization (by role, BU, geography)?

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Functional Strategy
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Conversational Q&A (Bedrock + Knowledge Base).  
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Action mode (tool invocation via Lambdas).  
- [ ] Clearly list which actions require human review or approvals.
- [ ] Define fallback mechanisms when KB has no answer.
- [ ] Identify external systems to integrate (SailPoint, HRMS, Jira, etc.).
- [ ] Decide on supported interfaces (Google Chat DMs, web portal, future Slack).

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Responsible AI & Ethical Foundations
- [ ] Align with **Responsible AI principles**: fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy.  
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop escalation for unclear or sensitive cases.  
- [ ] Bias audits for role- or location-specific answers.  
- [ ] Guardrails to prevent discriminatory or harmful advice.  
- [ ] User disclosures and opt-out options.  
- [ ] Regular red-team and safety evaluations.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy, Security & Governance
*(link this with your ‚ÄúResponsible AI & Security Guide‚Äù)*  
- [ ] Data minimization: only send non-PII context to the model.  
- [ ] Role-based access, encryption, and network isolation.  
- [ ] Guardrails, audit logs, approval workflows.  
- [ ] Policy for data retention & deletion (chat history, logs, KB docs).  
- [ ] Periodic compliance review (ISO 27001, SOC 2, DPDP Act, GDPR).

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data & Knowledge Strategy
- [ ] Identify **source of truth** for knowledge (HR docs, IT playbooks, FAQs).  
- [ ] Decide on **data format & ingestion** (S3 sync from GitHub repos, PDFs, HTML).  
- [ ] Define metadata tagging: department, region, version, confidentiality.  
- [ ] Create validation workflow: human review before KB sync.  
- [ ] Establish versioning & rollback process for outdated or incorrect info.  
- [ ] Plan for evaluation sets (Q&A pairs for accuracy testing).

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Architecture Readiness
- [ ] High-level system diagram (Chat ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Bedrock ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí KB).  
- [ ] Decide where to host orchestration (AWS vs hybrid GCP).  
- [ ] Choose Bedrock model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Titan Text G1).  
- [ ] Lambda design pattern (one per action vs. router).  
- [ ] Error handling & retry strategy.  
- [ ] Observability: logs, metrics, traces (CloudWatch + X-Ray).  
- [ ] Scalability & cost optimization planning (concurrency, caching).

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Product Design & UX
- [ ] Tone & personality of the assistant (friendly / formal / neutral).  
- [ ] Message templates & card formats for Google Chat.  
- [ ] Onboarding journey visualization (Day 0 ‚Üí Day 30).  
- [ ] Accessibility & multi-language support.  
- [ ] Feedback / rating mechanism (‚ÄúWas this helpful?‚Äù).

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Operational Excellence
- [ ] Dashboards for usage, latency, accuracy, refusal rate, and feedback.  
- [ ] Automated health checks for Bedrock API and Lambdas.  
- [ ] Alerting on anomalies or guardrail violations.  
- [ ] Incident response runbooks & escalation path.  
- [ ] Capacity & cost tracking (monthly cost per 1k interactions).

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Compliance & Legal Preparation
- [ ] Data-processing impact assessment (DPIA).  
- [ ] Review company‚Äôs internal AI policy.  
- [ ] Draft acceptable-use policy for end-users.  
- [ ] Define consent & disclaimer statements.  
- [ ] Plan legal review for KB content (no copyrighted/unapproved material).

## üîü Success Metrics & KPIs
| Category | Metric | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Accuracy | % grounded answers | ‚â• 90 % |
| Safety | % safe outputs | ‚â• 99.5 % |
| Efficiency | Avg response time | ‚â§ 2 s |
| Adoption | Active users / month | +50 % MoM growth |
| Cost | Cost / 1k queries | <$0.10 |
| Feedback | User satisfaction | ‚â• 4.5 / 5 |

## 11Ô∏è‚É£ Future Readiness (Next Iterations)
- [ ] ‚ÄúAgent mode‚Äù (tool execution via Lambdas).  
- [ ] Step Functions for multi-step workflows.  
- [ ] Integration with Slack / MS Teams.  
- [ ] Enterprise analytics dashboard (HR + IT insights).  
- [ ] Voice / multimodal interface (Lex or Bedrock multimodal).  
- [ ] Q Business connector for GitHub, Confluence, SharePoint.  
- [ ] Continuous learning pipeline (feedback ‚Üí KB update).

---

## 12Ô∏è‚É£ Stakeholder Readiness
- [ ] Identify RACI matrix (Product Owner, Security, AI Ops, Legal, Infra).

- [ ] Plan for internal beta and feedback collection.  
- [ ] Define maintenance owners (post-launch).

## ‚úÖ Outcome
Once all sections above are clarified and approved, the team will move to:
1. Drafting the **Full PRD** (problems, features, UX flows, APIs).  
2. Creating the **Architecture Blueprint**.  
3. Finalizing the **Security Review & Risk Register**.  
4. Beginning Phase 1 implementation (Chatbot + Bedrock KB).
