Absolutely! Here's a quick list of focused and practical questions you can ask on the call to clarify the scope and plan your next steps:


---

1. Clarity on Objective

What exactly do we mean by "deploying Compass"? Are we building something on top of Compass, integrating it, or automating configurations?

Since Compass is a SaaS product, are we managing integrations (e.g., via APIs) or deploying Compass-related metadata using CI/CD?



---

2. CI/CD Scope

Is the Jenkins infrastructure already set up and ready to use, or does it need to be created/configured?

What components are expected to be part of the CI/CD pipeline? (e.g., plugin builds, service metadata registration, API integration?)

Is there a Jenkinsfile or existing job we can refer to for context?



---

3. Code and Infra

Can someone walk me through the code repositories — both the application and infrastructure repos?

What does the infra repo provision? Are we using Terraform or CDK? Are there Compass components being registered as code?

Are there any environment-specific configs (Dev, UAT, PROD) that we need to automate deployment into?



---

4. Access & Permissions

Do I already have all the necessary accesses (AWS VPN, Jenkins, GitHub, Jira, Compass Admin/API access)?

Are there any specific AD groups I should request to be added to for each AWS environment?



---

5. Integration Touchpoints

Are we integrating Compass with GitHub, Jira, or any internal deployment tools?

Are we emitting deployment events or service health/status updates to Compass from Jenkins?



---

6. Support & KT

Who set this up originally? Can I get a quick KT session or documentation on what’s already built and how it fits together?

Are there any architectural diagrams or flowcharts that explain how Compass, Jenkins, and AWS interact?



---

You can open with:

> “Hey, before jumping in, I wanted to quickly align on what’s expected from this CI/CD deployment for Compass, since it’s a SaaS product — are we integrating, deploying extensions, or automating configurations?”



Let me know how the call goes — I can help you summarize the discussion or draft a refined requirements doc next.
