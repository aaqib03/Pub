Delivery Achievements â€“ Q4

1. Terraform Refactoring and Environment Setup

Consolidated multiple roles for Terraform-based EC2 instance automation, simplifying and streamlining deployment processes for all regions and UAT environments.

Refactored Terraform projects to segregate UAT and PROD resources, ensuring better resource isolation and enhancing environment-specific control.

Improved flexibility and control by replacing hardcoded values with variables, making infrastructure-as-code modules more scalable and reusable.


2. Deployment and Testing of Transfer Services

Deployed new SFTP transfer servers in multiple regions, including us-east-2, ensuring service availability and enhancing regional redundancy.

Migrated SCB UAT clients to the latest version of the transfer service (V3 module), which introduced enhanced features and stability.

Performed large file transfer tests using the latest module versions, validating scalability for file sizes beyond regular thresholds.


3. Security Enhancements

Successfully integrated GuardDuty malware protection with the transfer service, ensuring file scanning capabilities and secure operations across all deployments.

Conducted a cloud demonstration of malware detection and worked on decommissioning deprecated services blocked by freeze periods.


4. Infrastructure Optimization

Upgraded EBS volumes from gp2 to gp3 in a P-type environment, validating performance improvements and understanding potential impacts for a broader rollout.

Tested the EBS upgrade process thoroughly, ensuring a smooth transition for production use.


5. Incident Resolution

Resolved critical incidents, including identifying and implementing changes to CloudWatch alarms and administrative role permissions.

Addressed DAG failures on production servers by clearing space and optimizing workflows, preventing operational disruptions.


6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

Created detailed documentation for the malware integration process, transfer services, and newly deployed modules to improve operational transparency and assist in onboarding new team members.


7. Miscellaneous Enhancements

Supported module corrections for scheme server deployments, ensuring alignment with compliance and business requirements.

Collected missing core components for the transfer service layer to achieve a unified baseline for core layer deployments across regions.
