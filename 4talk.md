## Comparison Table

| #  | Criteria               | Lambda-Based Approach                           | Step Function-Based Approach                     |
|----|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | **Performance**        | Low latency, real-time processing | Higher latency due to step execution overhead |
| 2  | **Volume Handling**    | Handles moderate to high file volume | Can handle large file volume but with execution overhead |
| 3  | **Concurrency**        | Limited concurrency (1000 per account by default) | Built-in parallelism with state tracking |
| 4  | **Batch Processing**   | Supported via SQS batch processing | Natively supports batch and sequential execution |
| 5  | **Large File Handling**| Files remain in S3; Lambda makes API calls | Step Functions allow orchestrated retries |
| 6  | **Failure Handling**   | Retries needed via SQS DLQ | Built-in retries and error handling |
| 7  | **Scalability**        | Scales automatically, but concurrency limits apply | High scalability with controlled execution |
| 8  | **Cost Efficiency**    | High execution cost for high volume | Pay per step, better for long workflows |
| 9  | **Ease of Maintenance**| Easier to deploy but requires external monitoring | Provides built-in state tracking and logs |
| 10 | **Security**           | IAM roles restrict API calls | IAM roles control execution at each step |

## When to Use Each Approach

### âœ… Use the **Lambda-Based Approach** when:
- **High-volume, real-time processing** is required.
- **Parallel execution and batch processing via SQS** is needed.
- **Low-latency, event-driven execution** is a priority.
- You want **direct API calls** without overhead from Step Functions.

### âœ… Use the **Step Function-Based Approach** when:
- **Orchestrated workflows with strict execution order** are needed.
- **File transfer state tracking and visibility** is a key requirement.
- You need **built-in retries, error handling, and monitoring**.
- **Batch processing with sequential steps** (encryption, logging) is required.

## Next Steps
- If **real-time, scalable processing** is needed â†’ **Deploy Lambda + SQS**.
- If **controlled execution and logging visibility** are key â†’ **Use Step Functions**.
