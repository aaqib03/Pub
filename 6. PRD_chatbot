## AI Onboarding & Workplace Assistant  
**Version:** v1.0‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ**Owner:** Tibbi Labs‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ**Last Updated:** October 2025

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Executive Summary
Enterprises struggle with fragmented onboarding ‚Äî new hires must navigate multiple tools (HR, IT, access, policy documents) to become productive.  
This project builds an **AI-powered Onboarding & Workplace Assistant** that:
- Answers employee questions via **Google Chat**  
- Leverages **Amazon Bedrock** for intelligent responses  
- Uses a **central Knowledge Base (S3 + GitHub)** for accuracy and compliance  
- Later evolves into an **Action-oriented Agent** that can execute tasks (e.g., raise access requests)

**Phase 1 Goal:** Deploy a secure, role-aware chatbot that personalizes answers from internal knowledge.  
**Phase 2 Goal:** Extend to an intelligent agent that performs approved workflows via Lambdas.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement
**Current pain points**
- Onboarding processes span HR, IT, and Security with siloed tools.  
- Employees raise redundant tickets and face delays.  
- Information is dispersed across Confluence, PDFs, and emails.  
- Lack of visibility into what access or tasks are pending.  

**Vision**
> A single conversational interface where every employee can ask, *‚ÄúWhat do I need to do next?‚Äù* ‚Äî and instantly get accurate, contextual, and safe responses.
