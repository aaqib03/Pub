# 🚀 Implementation Roadmap – Phase 1 (Chatbot MVP)
**Project:** AI Onboarding & Workplace Assistant  
**Owner:** Tibbi Labs | **Version:** v1.0 | **Timeline:** ~6 weeks (MVP)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Deliver a **secure, role-aware onboarding assistant** integrated with Google Chat, powered by **Amazon Bedrock + Knowledge Base**, with full logging, safety, and monitoring.

---

## 📆 High-Level Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Sprint 1 | Week 1-2 | Foundation & Infra Setup |
| Sprint 2 | Week 3-4 | Knowledge Base + Chatbot Integration |
| Sprint 3 | Week 5-6 | Testing, Evaluation & Launch |

---

## 🧩 Sprint 1 — Foundation & Infra Setup (Weeks 1–2)

### Goals
- Provision all AWS components.
- Configure secure Google Chat webhook integration.
- Establish Dev → Stage → Prod environments.

### Deliverables
| Task | Description | Owner |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 1.1 | Create AWS account structure + VPC (private subnets for Lambdas & Bedrock access) | DevOps Team |
| 1.2 | Set up Terraform modules (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch) | DevOps Team |
| 1.3 | Register Google Chat bot + webhook endpoint | GCP Admin |
| 1.4 | Configure IAM roles with least privilege for each Lambda and Bedrock access | Security Team |
| 1.5 | Set up GitHub repo structure (`/infra`, `/lambda`, `/kb_sync`, `/docs`) | Product + DevOps |
| 1.6 | Establish CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions → Terraform Apply → AWS Deploy) | DevOps |
| 1.7 | Configure CloudWatch dashboards for Lambda metrics (latency, invocations, errors) | DevOps |

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ All infra components deployed via Terraform  
✅ Chat bot webhook verified and secure  
✅ Bedrock access granted and tested via API  

---

## 🧠 Sprint 2 — Knowledge Base & Chatbot Integration (Weeks 3–4)

### Goals
- Build and sync Knowledge Base from GitHub to S3.  
- Integrate Bedrock chat with Google Chat DM interface.  
- Implement logging and feedback mechanisms.

### Deliverables
| Task | Description | Owner |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 2.1 | Create GitHub Action to sync docs → S3 (`aws s3 sync --delete`) | DevOps |
| 2.2 | Configure Bedrock Knowledge Base (S3 source + embedding model) | AI Team |
| 2.3 | Develop Lambda `chat-webhook` → route Chat input to Bedrock | Backend Engineer |
| 2.4 | Define prompt templates (system + user roles + tone) | AI Team |
| 2.5 | Add Bedrock Guardrails (PII filter, topic deny list) | Security Team |
| 2.6 | Store each interaction in DynamoDB (user, timestamp, intent, response) | Backend |
| 2.7 | Implement 👍/👎 feedback button in Chat card responses | Frontend (UX) |
| 2.8 | Add CloudWatch metrics for token usage & guardrail violations | DevOps |
| 2.9 | Run 5–10 end-to-end sample queries for HR & IT content | QA Team |

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ Responses factual and grounded (≥ 90 % accuracy)  
✅ PII redaction working correctly  
✅ Feedback stored successfully in DB  
✅ Average latency ≤ 2 s  

---

## 🧪 Sprint 3 — Testing & Launch (Weeks 5–6)

### Goals
- Validate accuracy, safety, and performance.  
- Conduct UAT with HR + IT teams.  
- Prepare monitoring and go-live checklist.

### Deliverables
| Task | Description | Owner |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 3.1 | Build evaluation dataset (> 100 Q&A pairs from KB) | AI Team |
| 3.2 | Automated accuracy tests (grounded answers + citations) | QA |
| 3.3 | Run safety tests (prompt injection, bias, toxicity) | Security Team |
| 3.4 | Conduct UAT sessions with 10–15 pilot users | Product Team |
| 3.5 | Tune temperature and guardrails per feedback | AI Lead |
| 3.6 | Finalize operational dashboards (latency, accuracy, usage, cost) | DevOps |
| 3.7 | Draft launch announcement + training material | Comms + HR |
| 3.8 | Go-Live in Production | All Teams |

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ Accuracy ≥ 90 % ✅ Unsafe prompt rate ≤ 0.5 %  
✅ Latency ≤ 2 s ✅ User satisfaction ≥ 4.5 / 5  
✅ All security checks approved

## 🔁 Post-Launch (Continuous Improvement)
| Area | Action | Frequency |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Feedback Loop** | Review thumbs-down responses → update KB | Weekly |
| **KB Ingestion** | Auto re-sync GitHub → S3 → Bedrock | Continuous |
| **Guardrail Review** | Analyze violations & adjust deny lists | Monthly |
| **Performance** | Monitor token usage & cost dashboards | Ongoing |
| **User Adoption** | Track active users & onboarding completion | Monthly |
