Perfect üëç‚Äîyou‚Äôve now locked in your architecture and design, so the next milestone is the MVP Implementation Document, which takes your PRD and Architecture and turns them into a build-ready delivery plan with detailed features, tasks, success metrics, and integration notes.

Below is the full MVP_IMPLEMENTATION.md, ready to go in your repo.

# üöÄ MVP Implementation Document
## AI Onboarding & Workplace Assistant (Phase 1)
**Version:** v1.0‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ**Owner:** Tibbi Labs‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ**Last Updated:** October 2025

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective
Deliver a **secure, role-aware AI chatbot** integrated with Google Chat and powered by **Amazon Bedrock + Knowledge Base**, to answer employee onboarding and workplace queries.

This MVP focuses on **information retrieval and guidance**, not action execution (which will come in Phase 2).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scope

### ‚úÖ In Scope (Phase 1)
| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Channel** | Google Chat (1:1 DM bot, not spaces) |
| **Knowledge Source** | S3-based Knowledge Base synced from GitHub |
| **AI Layer** | Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with Guardrails) |
| **Backend** | AWS Lambda (Python 3.12) via API Gateway |
| **Data Store** | DynamoDB (sessions, logs, context) |
| **Infra-as-Code** | Terraform (multi-env: dev, stage, prod) |
| **Observability** | CloudWatch + structured logs |
| **Security** | IAM least privilege, TLS, Secrets Manager, Bedrock Guardrails |

### ‚ùå Out of Scope (for now)
| Area | Rationale |
|-------|------------|
| Tool/action execution (e.g., access requests) | Deferred to Phase 2 (Agent Mode) |
| MCP server integration | Optional for later |
| Multi-language or voice input | Planned for Phase 3 |
| HR analytics dashboard | Phase 3 reporting feature |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Features & Deliverables

| Feature | Description | Priority | Owner |
|----------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Google Chat Bot** | Employee-facing DM bot that handles Q&A and context tracking | P1 | DevOps + Backend |
| **Webhook + Lambda handler** | API Gateway + Lambda receives and processes messages | P1 | Backend |
| **Knowledge Base (S3)** | KB populated from GitHub Docs / HR / IT / Policies | P1 | AI + DevOps |
| **Bedrock KB Integration** | Bedrock Knowledge Base with Guardrails for safe responses | P1 | AI Team |
| **Feedback capture** | üëç / üëé capture in Google Chat message cards | P2 | UX |
| **Metrics logging** | Logs to DynamoDB + CloudWatch (latency, accuracy, usage) | P1 | DevOps |
| **GitHub ‚Üí S3 Sync** | Automated sync workflow (GitHub Actions) | P2 | DevOps |
| **Guardrails & Safety Filters** | PII filter, sensitive topic blocks, output moderation | P1 | Security |
| **Monitoring Dashboards** | CloudWatch dashboards for latency, token usage, KB jobs | P2 | DevOps |
