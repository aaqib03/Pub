1. Overview: What is an Application Security Champion?

An Application Security Champion is a nominated engineer within a team responsible for:

Ensuring secure coding practices are followed.

Identifying, tracking, and remediating vulnerabilities in the application.

Acting as the main point of contact between the development team and the security team.

Driving security awareness in the squad.

Ensuring every sprint includes vulnerability fixes and the team maintains security hygiene.



---

2. Core Responsibilities

2.1 Vulnerability Management

Track vulnerabilities in Microsoft Defender/MicroScans/SAST–DAST tools.

Raise one sprint-wise remediation ticket every sprint.

Follow up with team members to ensure vulnerabilities are fixed.

Validate and close vulnerabilities after remediation.


2.2 Secure Coding

Ensure no sensitive information or credentials are hard-coded.

Promote use of secure patterns, least privilege, encryption, and secrets management.

Review pull requests for security issues.

Ensure the team follows the secure coding warrior guidelines.


2.3 Communication with Security Team

Attend Security Champion meetings and bootcamps.

Provide updates to the Security Team regarding sprint-level vulnerability status.

Help triage and clarify vulnerability reports raised by the security team.

3. Onboarding Process to Become a Security Champion

You must follow these official steps:

Step 1 – Manager Nomination

Inform your manager you want to join the Security Champion Program.

Manager sends your nomination to the Application Security Team.


Step 2 – Add to Security Channels

Once nominated, you get:

Added to Security Champion group chats

Access to the Secure Code Warrior Portal


Step 3 – Attend the Security Bootcamp

Mandatory 1-hour bootcamp

Covers:

Overview of the Security Champion role

Vulnerability lifecycle

Secure coding concepts

Course & exam process



Step 4 – Secure Code Warrior Portal Access

You receive access to:

Secure Code Warrior (SCW) dashboard

Language-specific training modules
(e.g., Terraform AWS, Python, Java, JS—depending on your tech stack)


Step 5 – Complete All Awareness Courses

Before you can take the exam, you must complete:

Sensitive Data Storage

Access Control

Input Validation

Authentication & Authorization

Terraform/AWS security practices (if your track)


Each module includes:

Videos

Knowledge checks

Vulnerability detection exercises

Code fix challenges


Step 6 – Take the Assessment

Exam Format: MCQ + code vulnerability correction

Duration: 1 hour

Questions: 5 scenario-based questions

You must:

Identify vulnerability in a given code snippet

Choose the correct remediation or safe technique



If you fail:

You can retake after completing the modules again.

No removal unless you remain inactive.

4. Exam Expectations & Preparation

4.1 What Type of Questions to Expect

Identify what part of code introduces vulnerability.

Select correct remediation.

Validate secure patterns around:

Access control

Secrets handling

Terraform misconfigurations (open S3 bucket, public SG, plaintext IAM keys)

Input validation

Least privilege



4.2 Tips to Pass

✔ Complete all modules (they contain EXACT patterns used in exam)
✔ Practice the "challenges" multiple times
✔ Focus on Terraform AWS modules if that’s your tech stack
✔ Keep notes on:

insecure code patterns

secure alternatives (KMS, encrypted storage, restricted IAM roles, etc.)
