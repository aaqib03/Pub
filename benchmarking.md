Lambda Performance Testing Report

1. Introduction

The purpose of this report is to assess the performance, stability, and scalability of the Lambda function under different file sizes, memory configurations, and GuardDuty (GD) malware scanning conditions. The results will help improve product efficiency and provide insights for optimization.


---

2. Performance Metrics

2.1 Lambda V13 (GuardDuty Enabled)


---

2.2 Lambda V12 (GuardDuty Disabled)


---

3. Key Comparisons and Visuals

3.1 Processing Time Impact (GuardDuty Enabled vs. Disabled)

3.2 Visualization: Processing Time Comparison

Below is a bar chart illustrating the percentage increase in processing time due to GuardDuty scanning.




---

4. Recommendations

1. Optimize GuardDuty Scan Time: Explore ways to reduce the scan time, possibly by optimizing I/O operations or using parallel scanning.


2. Increase Timeout Limits: For large files, consider increasing the Lambda timeout limit to avoid task failures.


3. Adjust Memory Allocation: Analyze the memory usage patterns to determine if higher memory allocation reduces processing time.


4. Implement Asynchronous Processing: For large workloads, consider breaking tasks into multiple asynchronous invocations.
