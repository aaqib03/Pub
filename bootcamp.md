# AWS Networking Demo Notes

## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- **Definition:** A private, isolated network in AWS where resources run.  
- **Problem it Solves:** Without isolation, resources in the cloud can be accidentally exposed. Need control over which servers are public vs private.  
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** Defines the IP address range of the VPC. Example: `10.0.0.0/16` ‚Üí ~65,000 IPs. Must avoid overlaps.  
- **How VPC Helps:** Provides IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways to structure the network.  
- **Example:**  
  - VPC: `10.0.0.0/16`  
  - Public Subnet: `10.0.1.0/24` for web servers  
  - Private Subnet: `10.0.2.0/24` for database  
  - IGW only attached to public subnet ‚Üí secure architecture.

---

## Route 53 Resolver & VPC Router

### VPC Router
- Default, invisible router in every VPC.  
- Forwards traffic between subnets, IGW, NAT, VPN, etc.  
- Reads **Route Tables** to decide next hop.  

### Route 53 Resolver
- Built-in DNS resolver at **10.0.0.2**.  
- Resolves AWS services (`s3.amazonaws.com`), private hosted zones, and external domains.  
- Ensures workloads can resolve names to IPs without needing external DNS.

---

## Internet Gateway (IGW)

- A redundant gateway that connects VPC to internet.  
- Needed for public subnets to reach the internet.  
- Works with route tables (`0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW`).  
- Example: Public EC2 web server with Elastic IP.

---

## Subnets

- Subdivisions of a VPC CIDR. Each subnet is tied to one **AZ**.  
- **Public Subnet:** Connected to IGW for internet-facing workloads.  
- **Private Subnet:** No IGW access, used for internal resources.  
- Example:  
  - VPC: `10.0.0.0/24`  
  - Public Subnet: `10.0.0.0/25`  
  - Private Subnet: `10.0.0.128/25`

---

## Route Tables

- A set of rules (Destination ‚Üí Target) for directing traffic.  
- **Local routes** allow all subnets in a VPC to communicate.  
- Example Routes:  
  - Public Subnet: `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW`  
  - Private Subnet: `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway`  

---

## Route to Internet

- Public subnet needs a default route (`0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW`) for internet access.  
- Without this, instances won‚Äôt reach the internet even if IGW is attached.  

---

## Internet Access ‚Äì Compute in Public Subnet

- Requires:  
  1. Subnet route to IGW.  
  2. A public IP or Elastic IP.  
- IGW performs **1:1 NAT** between private and public IPs.  
- Example: EC2 `10.0.0.10` with Elastic IP `3.x.x.x`.

---

## Internet Access ‚Äì Compute in Private Subnet

- Private subnets use **NAT Gateway** for outbound-only internet access.  
- NAT is deployed in a public subnet with an Elastic IP.  
- Route: `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway`.  
- Instances can pull updates, call APIs, but cannot be reached from internet.

---

## NAT Gateway ‚Äì Key Concepts

- **Definition:** AWS-managed service enabling outbound internet from private subnets while blocking unsolicited inbound.  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Maintains stateful mappings of outbound connections.  
  - Only responses to existing connections are allowed back.  
  - Random inbound traffic is dropped.  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Fully managed, scalable, highly available.  
  - Deployed in public subnet with Elastic IP.

---

## Multiple Availability Zones (AZs)

- AZs = independent datacenters in a Region.  
- Deploy across multiple AZs for **High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery**.  
- Examples:  
  - RDS Multi-AZ ‚Üí automatic failover.  
  - ALB + ASG ‚Üí spread workloads across AZs.  
- Best Practice ‚Üí Always deploy in at least 2 AZs.

---

## Access to AWS Services? (Problem)

- Private subnet workloads often need to access AWS services like **S3, Secrets Manager, KMS**.  
- AWS services expose **public APIs**.  
- Private subnets don‚Äôt have IGW or public IPs ‚Üí cannot reach them directly.  
- Question: *How do private subnets talk to AWS services?*

---

## Access via VPC Endpoints (Solution)

- **VPC Endpoints** provide private connectivity between VPCs and AWS services.  
- **Traffic Flow:**  
  1. EC2 makes call ‚Üí e.g., `s3.amazonaws.com`.  
  2. **Route 53 Resolver** (10.0.0.2) resolves DNS to endpoint IP.  
  3. **VPC Router** forwards traffic to endpoint.  
  4. **VPC Endpoint** securely connects to service within AWS backbone.  
- **Types:**  
  - **Gateway Endpoints** ‚Üí S3, DynamoDB.  
  - **Interface Endpoints** ‚Üí most other services (Secrets Manager, KMS, SSM).  
- **Benefit:** No NAT/IGW needed, traffic stays inside AWS, more secure and cheaper.

---

## Gateway Endpoints (S3/DynamoDB)

- Special endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB.  
- Added via **route table prefix lists**.  
- Even if DNS resolves to public IP, routing forces traffic through AWS private backbone.  
- Cheaper and efficient for high-volume traffic like S3.  

---

## Gateway Endpoints with DNS Resolution

- Query like `s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` resolves to **public IPs**.  
- But route table prefix lists ensure traffic routes internally via Gateway Endpoint.  
- Key point ‚Üí DNS resolves public IP, routing ensures traffic stays private.  

---

## Interface Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)

- **What they are:** ENIs with private IPs in your subnets that proxy to AWS services.  
- **Why:** Allow private-subnet instances to call service APIs (Secrets Manager, KMS, etc.) without NAT/IGW.  
- **Traffic flow:**  
  1. App calls `secretsmanager.<region>.amazonaws.com`.  
  2. **Route 53 Resolver** ‚Üí resolves to endpoint ENI IP (if Private DNS enabled).  
  3. **VPC Router** forwards traffic to local ENI.  
  4. ENI proxies traffic to AWS service via PrivateLink.  
- **Security:** Endpoint SGs, endpoint policies, per-AZ design for HA.  
- **Cost:** Pay per endpoint + data. Prefer Gateway Endpoint for S3/DynamoDB.

---

## Interface Endpoints ‚Äì Deep Dive (Private DNS, IPs, ENIs)

- **Private DNS:**  
  - If enabled ‚Üí standard AWS service hostnames (e.g., `secretsmanager.<region>.amazonaws.com`) resolve to the **private IPs of the endpoint ENIs** in your VPC.  
  - If disabled ‚Üí hostnames resolve to **public IPs**; you must instead use the special endpoint-specific DNS name (`vpce-xxxx.vpce.amazonaws.com`) for private routing.  
  - *Enabling Private DNS makes the experience seamless ‚Äì applications don‚Äôt need code/config changes.*  

- **Do endpoints have IPs?**  
  - **Gateway Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB):**  
    - Do not create IPs or ENIs.  
    - Use **prefix lists in route tables** to forward traffic to the service internally.  
  - **Interface Endpoints (all other services):**  
    - Do create **ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)** inside your subnets.  
    - Each ENI has a **private IP address**.  
    - Your traffic is routed to those ENIs ‚Üí then forwarded to the AWS service via **PrivateLink**.  

- **What is an ENI (Elastic Network Interface)?**  
  - A virtual network card inside AWS.  
  - Belongs to a **subnet and AZ**.  
  - Has: private IP(s), optional public IP/EIP, one or more Security Groups, MAC address.  
  - Can be attached to an EC2 instance or owned by another AWS resource (like a VPC Endpoint).  

- **How traffic flows with Interface Endpoints:**  
  1. Instance calls AWS service API (e.g., Secrets Manager).  
  2. **Route 53 Resolver (10.0.0.2)** resolves the DNS ‚Üí to the endpoint ENI‚Äôs private IP (if Private DNS enabled).  
  3. **VPC Router** routes packet locally to the ENI (no extra route needed).  
  4. ENI forwards traffic through **AWS PrivateLink** to the service.  
  5. Response returns via ENI ‚Üí router ‚Üí instance.  

- **Key Security & Design Points:**  
  - **Attach SGs** to endpoint ENIs to limit which clients can use the endpoint.  
  - **Endpoint Policy** to restrict service actions/resources.  
  - Place endpoints in **each AZ** to avoid cross-AZ traffic charges.  
  - Use **Gateway Endpoints** for S3/DynamoDB where possible (cost-effective).


## AWS Network Security Services ‚Äì Speaker Notes

---

## üîπ AWS Network Firewall (ANFW)

- ‚ÄúAWS Network Firewall is a **managed, stateful firewall service** for our VPCs and subnets.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIt goes beyond what Security Groups and NACLs can do ‚Äî they only filter by IP, port, and protocol. They cannot do deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, or domain filtering.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWith Network Firewall, we can enforce **centralized security policies** across entire subnets.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIt supports **IDS/IPS** using industry-standard Suricata rules and can block or alert on malicious traffic patterns.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúTraffic flows through **firewall endpoints** deployed in firewall subnets. Inbound traffic from the internet, or outbound traffic from protected subnets, is inspected here before being allowed.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúThis allows us to block malicious IPs or domains, prevent data exfiltration, and log all traffic for analysis in **CloudWatch, S3, or Kinesis**.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIn short, Network Firewall provides **centralized, advanced traffic inspection** across workloads ‚Äî something Security Groups and NACLs alone cannot achieve.‚Äù  

---

## üîπ AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- ‚ÄúAWS WAF is a **web application firewall** that protects HTTP and HTTPS traffic at the **application layer (Layer 7)**.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWe attach WAF to entry points like **CloudFront, Application Load Balancer, API Gateway, or AppSync**.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIt protects applications from **common web exploits** such as **SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and bot attacks**.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWAF uses **AWS Managed Rule Groups**, or we can write our own custom rules. For example, we can block requests with suspicious headers or from certain IPs.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúTraffic first comes through our load balancer or CloudFront. WAF inspects the HTTP(S) requests before they reach our backend applications.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúFor example, if an attacker tries SQL injection on our login page, WAF blocks that request at the edge. Our app never even sees it.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúSo in summary, WAF gives **application-level protection** for web servers and APIs that network firewalls or SGs cannot provide.‚Äù  

---

## üîπ AWS Shield

- ‚ÄúAWS Shield is a **managed DDoS protection service**.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIt comes in two tiers: **Shield Standard** and **Shield Advanced**.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúShield Standard is **free and always on**. It protects against common volumetric and protocol-level DDoS attacks.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúShield Advanced is **paid**, and provides stronger detection, advanced mitigations, detailed reports, cost protection, and support from the AWS DDoS Response Team.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúShield protects critical services like **Route 53 (DNS)**, **CloudFront**, **Application Load Balancers**, and works hand-in-hand with **WAF**.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúFor example, DNS-based attacks are common. Since every internet connection starts with DNS, attackers may try to flood DNS servers. Shield Advanced integrated with Route 53 ensures DNS queries are always protected.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúSo while WAF protects against **application-layer attacks**, and Network Firewall protects **subnet-level traffic**, Shield protects us from **large-scale DDoS attacks** that could take services offline.‚Äù

# Can We Attach Security Groups to S3 or SNS?

---

## 1. Security Group Basics
- **Security Groups (SGs)** work only with resources that have **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** inside our VPC.  
- Examples: EC2 instances, RDS databases, Load Balancers, Lambda (in VPC), Interface Endpoints.  
- SGs filter **inbound and outbound traffic** at the VPC network level (IP, port, protocol).  

---

## 2. Why Not for S3 or SNS?
- **S3, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, etc. are regional AWS services**, not deployed inside customer VPCs.  
- They **do not create ENIs inside our VPC**. Their networking is managed by AWS on their side.  
- Since there‚Äôs no ENI in our VPC, we cannot attach a Security Group to these services directly.  

üëâ That‚Äôs why S3 and SNS access is controlled differently ‚Äî through **resource policies** and **IAM**, not SGs.

---

## 3. How Do We Secure Them Then?

### a) Resource Policies
- **S3:** Use **Bucket Policies**.  
- **SNS/SQS:** Use **Topic/Queue Policies**.  
- These control **who (IAM principals) can access** the service and what actions they can perform.  

---

### b) VPC Endpoints
- To add **network-level restrictions**, we use **VPC Endpoints**.  
- **Gateway Endpoint (S3/DynamoDB):**  
  - Configured in the VPC route tables.  
  - Redirects S3 traffic over the private AWS backbone, not the internet.  
- **Interface Endpoint (for SNS, SQS, many other services):**  
  - Creates an **ENI inside your VPC**.  
  - You can attach a **Security Group** to that ENI.  
  - Restrict which instances/subnets can use the endpoint.  

---

## 4. But Doesn‚Äôt the Endpoint Allow All Buckets?
Yes ‚Äî by default:  
- An **S3 VPC Endpoint** gives access to the **entire S3 service** in that region.  
- It doesn‚Äôt restrict traffic to a specific bucket automatically.
