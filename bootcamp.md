# AWS Networking Demo Notes

## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- **Definition:** A private, isolated network in AWS where resources run.  
- **Problem it Solves:** Without isolation, resources in the cloud can be accidentally exposed. Need control over which servers are public vs private.  
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** Defines the IP address range of the VPC. Example: `10.0.0.0/16` ‚Üí ~65,000 IPs. Must avoid overlaps.  
- **How VPC Helps:** Provides IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways to structure the network.  
- **Example:**  
  - VPC: `10.0.0.0/16`  
  - Public Subnet: `10.0.1.0/24` for web servers  
  - Private Subnet: `10.0.2.0/24` for database  
  - IGW only attached to public subnet ‚Üí secure architecture.

---

## Route 53 Resolver & VPC Router

### VPC Router
- Default, invisible router in every VPC.  
- Forwards traffic between subnets, IGW, NAT, VPN, etc.  
- Reads **Route Tables** to decide next hop.  

### Route 53 Resolver
- Built-in DNS resolver at **10.0.0.2**.  
- Resolves AWS services (`s3.amazonaws.com`), private hosted zones, and external domains.  
- Ensures workloads can resolve names to IPs without needing external DNS.

---

## Internet Gateway (IGW)

- A redundant gateway that connects VPC to internet.  
- Needed for public subnets to reach the internet.  
- Works with route tables (`0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW`).  
- Example: Public EC2 web server with Elastic IP.

---

## Subnets

- Subdivisions of a VPC CIDR. Each subnet is tied to one **AZ**.  
- **Public Subnet:** Connected to IGW for internet-facing workloads.  
- **Private Subnet:** No IGW access, used for internal resources.  
- Example:  
  - VPC: `10.0.0.0/24`  
  - Public Subnet: `10.0.0.0/25`  
  - Private Subnet: `10.0.0.128/25`

---

## Route Tables

- A set of rules (Destination ‚Üí Target) for directing traffic.  
- **Local routes** allow all subnets in a VPC to communicate.  
- Example Routes:  
  - Public Subnet: `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW`  
  - Private Subnet: `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway`  

---

## Route to Internet

- Public subnet needs a default route (`0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW`) for internet access.  
- Without this, instances won‚Äôt reach the internet even if IGW is attached.  

---

## Internet Access ‚Äì Compute in Public Subnet

- Requires:  
  1. Subnet route to IGW.  
  2. A public IP or Elastic IP.  
- IGW performs **1:1 NAT** between private and public IPs.  
- Example: EC2 `10.0.0.10` with Elastic IP `3.x.x.x`.

---

## Internet Access ‚Äì Compute in Private Subnet

- Private subnets use **NAT Gateway** for outbound-only internet access.  
- NAT is deployed in a public subnet with an Elastic IP.  
- Route: `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway`.  
- Instances can pull updates, call APIs, but cannot be reached from internet.

---

## NAT Gateway ‚Äì Key Concepts

- **Definition:** AWS-managed service enabling outbound internet from private subnets while blocking unsolicited inbound.  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Maintains stateful mappings of outbound connections.  
  - Only responses to existing connections are allowed back.  
  - Random inbound traffic is dropped.  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Fully managed, scalable, highly available.  
  - Deployed in public subnet with Elastic IP.

---

## Multiple Availability Zones (AZs)

- AZs = independent datacenters in a Region.  
- Deploy across multiple AZs for **High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery**.  
- Examples:  
  - RDS Multi-AZ ‚Üí automatic failover.  
  - ALB + ASG ‚Üí spread workloads across AZs.  
- Best Practice ‚Üí Always deploy in at least 2 AZs.

---

## Access to AWS Services? (Problem)

- Private subnet workloads often need to access AWS services like **S3, Secrets Manager, KMS**.  
- AWS services expose **public APIs**.  
- Private subnets don‚Äôt have IGW or public IPs ‚Üí cannot reach them directly.  
- Question: *How do private subnets talk to AWS services?*

---

## Access via VPC Endpoints (Solution)

- **VPC Endpoints** provide private connectivity between VPCs and AWS services.  
- **Traffic Flow:**  
  1. EC2 makes call ‚Üí e.g., `s3.amazonaws.com`.  
  2. **Route 53 Resolver** (10.0.0.2) resolves DNS to endpoint IP.  
  3. **VPC Router** forwards traffic to endpoint.  
  4. **VPC Endpoint** securely connects to service within AWS backbone.  
- **Types:**  
  - **Gateway Endpoints** ‚Üí S3, DynamoDB.  
  - **Interface Endpoints** ‚Üí most other services (Secrets Manager, KMS, SSM).  
- **Benefit:** No NAT/IGW needed, traffic stays inside AWS, more secure and cheaper.

---

## Gateway Endpoints (S3/DynamoDB)

- Special endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB.  
- Added via **route table prefix lists**.  
- Even if DNS resolves to public IP, routing forces traffic through AWS private backbone.  
- Cheaper and efficient for high-volume traffic like S3.  

---

## Gateway Endpoints with DNS Resolution

- Query like `s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` resolves to **public IPs**.  
- But route table prefix lists ensure traffic routes internally via Gateway Endpoint.  
- Key point ‚Üí DNS resolves public IP, routing ensures traffic stays private.  

---

## Interface Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)

- **What they are:** ENIs with private IPs in your subnets that proxy to AWS services.  
- **Why:** Allow private-subnet instances to call service APIs (Secrets Manager, KMS, etc.) without NAT/IGW.  
- **Traffic flow:**  
  1. App calls `secretsmanager.<region>.amazonaws.com`.  
  2. **Route 53 Resolver** ‚Üí resolves to endpoint ENI IP (if Private DNS enabled).  
  3. **VPC Router** forwards traffic to local ENI.  
  4. ENI proxies traffic to AWS service via PrivateLink.  
- **Security:** Endpoint SGs, endpoint policies, per-AZ design for HA.  
- **Cost:** Pay per endpoint + data. Prefer Gateway Endpoint for S3/DynamoDB.

---

## Interface Endpoints ‚Äì Deep Dive (Private DNS, IPs, ENIs)

- **Private DNS:**  
  - If enabled ‚Üí standard AWS service hostnames (e.g., `secretsmanager.<region>.amazonaws.com`) resolve to the **private IPs of the endpoint ENIs** in your VPC.  
  - If disabled ‚Üí hostnames resolve to **public IPs**; you must instead use the special endpoint-specific DNS name (`vpce-xxxx.vpce.amazonaws.com`) for private routing.  
  - *Enabling Private DNS makes the experience seamless ‚Äì applications don‚Äôt need code/config changes.*  

- **Do endpoints have IPs?**  
  - **Gateway Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB):**  
    - Do not create IPs or ENIs.  
    - Use **prefix lists in route tables** to forward traffic to the service internally.  
  - **Interface Endpoints (all other services):**  
    - Do create **ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)** inside your subnets.  
    - Each ENI has a **private IP address**.  
    - Your traffic is routed to those ENIs ‚Üí then forwarded to the AWS service via **PrivateLink**.  

- **What is an ENI (Elastic Network Interface)?**  
  - A virtual network card inside AWS.  
  - Belongs to a **subnet and AZ**.  
  - Has: private IP(s), optional public IP/EIP, one or more Security Groups, MAC address.  
  - Can be attached to an EC2 instance or owned by another AWS resource (like a VPC Endpoint).  

- **How traffic flows with Interface Endpoints:**  
  1. Instance calls AWS service API (e.g., Secrets Manager).  
  2. **Route 53 Resolver (10.0.0.2)** resolves the DNS ‚Üí to the endpoint ENI‚Äôs private IP (if Private DNS enabled).  
  3. **VPC Router** routes packet locally to the ENI (no extra route needed).  
  4. ENI forwards traffic through **AWS PrivateLink** to the service.  
  5. Response returns via ENI ‚Üí router ‚Üí instance.  

- **Key Security & Design Points:**  
  - **Attach SGs** to endpoint ENIs to limit which clients can use the endpoint.  
  - **Endpoint Policy** to restrict service actions/resources.  
  - Place endpoints in **each AZ** to avoid cross-AZ traffic charges.  
  - Use **Gateway Endpoints** for S3/DynamoDB where possible (cost-effective).


# AWS Network Security Services ‚Äì Speaker Notes

## üîπ AWS Network Firewall (ANFW)

### Definition
- Managed, **stateful firewall** for VPCs and subnets.  
- Provides **IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention)**, deep packet inspection, and domain/IP/port-based filtering.  
- Deployed as **firewall endpoints** inside a dedicated **firewall subnet**.  

### Problem It Solves
- Security Groups protect individual instances (limited scope).  
- NACLs work at subnet level but are stateless and basic.  
- Need for **centralized inspection and uniform security policies** across workloads.  
- Helps prevent advanced attacks, block malicious domains, and control outbound traffic.  

### Speaking Points
- ‚ÄúAWS Network Firewall centralizes traffic inspection for subnets and workloads.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIt supports IDS/IPS and deep packet inspection, giving us advanced capabilities beyond SGs and NACLs.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúTraffic flows through firewall endpoints in firewall subnets, where it is inspected before being routed to protected subnets.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúThis ensures all inbound and outbound traffic is checked against consistent rules.‚Äù  

---

## üîπ AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### Definition
- **Application-layer firewall (Layer 7)** for **HTTP/HTTPS traffic**.  
- Can attach to **CloudFront, Application Load Balancers, API Gateway, AppSync**.  
- Uses **Managed Rule Groups** (SQLi, XSS, bots) or **custom rules**.  

### Problem It Solves
- Network Firewall doesn‚Äôt understand **application-specific exploits**.  
- Protects apps from **SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and malicious bots**.  
- Prevents invalid/malicious web requests from reaching backend applications.  

### Speaking Points
- ‚ÄúAWS WAF focuses on protecting web applications at the HTTP/HTTPS layer.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIt blocks application-specific threats like SQL injection and XSS.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúI can attach WAF to my ALB or CloudFront so that every request is inspected before reaching my app.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIt gives me flexibility to use AWS Managed Rules or build my own policies.‚Äù  

---

## üîπ AWS Shield

### Definition
- **Managed DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection service**.  
- **Shield Standard** ‚Üí Free, enabled by default, protects against common volumetric attacks.  
- **Shield Advanced** ‚Üí Paid, adds enhanced detection, detailed reporting, cost protection, and AWS DDoS Response Team support.  

### Problem It Solves
- Protects against **volumetric, protocol, and application-level DDoS attacks**.  
- DNS-based attacks (via Route 53) or massive floods can make apps unavailable.  
- Without Shield, critical services could be taken down.  

### Speaking Points
- ‚ÄúAWS Shield protects resources from DDoS attacks, which are among the most common internet threats today.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúShield Standard is always on and free, protecting AWS resources by default.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúShield Advanced offers additional support, detailed reporting, and integration with services like Route 53, ALB, and WAF.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúFor example, if attackers try to flood my DNS or load balancer, Shield keeps applications available and mitigates the attack automatically.‚Äù
