Answers to the Three Questions

1️⃣ Specify how file transfers will be triggered and automated using AWS services.

File transfers will be automated using AWS S3 Event Notifications, Lambda functions, and AWS Transfer Family (SFTP Connectors). The automation workflow follows these steps:

1. File Upload to S3: A file is uploaded to an S3 bucket (Client Bucket).


2. S3 Event Notification Trigger: S3 triggers an AWS Lambda function when a new file is created.


3. File Size Stability Check (Optional): The Lambda function verifies that the file is fully written before processing.


4. AWS SFTP Connector API Call: The Lambda function makes an API call to AWS Transfer Family (SFTP Connector) to securely transfer the file to the client’s remote SFTP server.


5. File Transfer Execution: The SFTP Connector establishes a secure SSH connection (TCP 22) with the client’s SFTP server and transfers the file.


6. Monitoring & Logging: AWS CloudWatch Logs and Metrics track file transfer success/failures.


7. Error Handling & Retries: If a transfer fails, an AWS Step Function or DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) handles retries.

2️⃣ Define S3 Event Notifications for outbound file pushes.

S3 Event Notifications will be used to trigger the Lambda function when a new file is uploaded. This can be configured with suffix filtering to ensure only fully written files are processed.

Steps to configure S3 Event Notifications:

1. Enable event notifications on the S3 bucket.


2. Filter files using suffix rules (e.g., trigger only for .csv files).


3. Invoke Lambda upon object creation (s3:ObjectCreated:*).


4. Pass event details (bucket name, object key) to the Lambda function.



Terraform Configuration Example:

resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "s3_event_trigger" {
  bucket = "client-bucket"

  lambda_function {
    lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.file_transfer_lambda.arn
    events              = ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
    filter_suffix       = ".csv"  # Ensures only fully written files trigger the event
  }
}

3️⃣ Identify Lambda functions and APIs needed to interact with external servers using SFTP connectors.

The Lambda function will interact with AWS Transfer Family’s SFTP Connector via API calls.

Lambda Function Responsibilities:

Receive the S3 event notification.

Verify file stability (optional, using s3.head_object).

Call AWS Transfer SFTP Connector API to initiate the file transfer.

Monitor transfer success/failure.

Log results to CloudWatch.

Retry on failure (via Step Functions or SQS DLQ).


Required AWS APIs:

1. Amazon S3 API (boto3) – To check file status.

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')


2. AWS Transfer API (boto3.transfer) – To call the SFTP connector.

transfer_client = boto3.client('transfer')
transfer_client.start_file_transfer(ConnectorId="connector-id", FileLocation="s3://client-bucket/file.csv")


3. AWS CloudWatch Logs API – For logging and monitoring.

logs_client = boto3.client('logs')
logs_client.put_log_events(...)


4. AWS Step Functions API (Optional) – If using a workflow for retries.

stepfunctions_client = boto3.client('stepfunctions')
