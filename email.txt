Subject: Important Update: Encryption Requirement for SFTP Connections to Our Server

Dear [Client's Name],

We are reaching out to inform you of an important update regarding the security of file transfers to our AWS SFTP server. To maintain a high standard of data protection, we have updated our server configuration to enforce the use of a stronger encryption algorithm for all SFTP connections.

What Has Changed

Our AWS SFTP server now requires a minimum encryption standard of AES-256-GCM for establishing secure connections. This updated requirement helps ensure that all data transferred between your SFTP client and our server is encrypted using a highly secure algorithm, in compliance with the latest information security practices.

What You Need to Do

To connect to our server successfully, please ensure that your SFTP client is configured to support AES-256-GCM (or a stronger cipher). Here are some steps to guide you:

1. Check Cipher Settings in Your SFTP Client: Many SFTP clients (e.g., WinSCP, FileZilla, Cyberduck) allow you to specify or prioritize ciphers in their settings. Please verify that AES-256-GCM is either enabled or prioritized in your client’s encryption options.


2. Update if Needed: If your current SFTP client does not support AES-256-GCM, you may need to update to a newer version or use an alternative client that includes this encryption option.


3. Test Connection: After adjusting the settings, we recommend testing your connection to ensure compatibility with our updated server policy and avoid any disruptions in file transfers.



Why This Update Matters

Using AES-256-GCM strengthens the encryption of the connection between your SFTP client and our server, protecting your data during transit. This change aligns with industry standards and best practices for secure file transfers.

If you have any questions or need assistance configuring your SFTP client, please feel free to reach out. We appreciate your cooperation in helping us maintain a secure and compliant environment for your data transfers.

Thank you for your attention to this update.

Best regards,
