# FIS-TSYS Merger Town Hall Meeting
**Date:** January 2026  
**Event:** FIS Acquisition of TSYS - Leadership Town Hall

---

## Opening Remarks - Local Leadership

**Speaker:** [Local Leader]

Good morning everyone. I want to start by saying how inspiring yesterday's broadcast was. I hope we can all watch it together once again - not the entire thing, but at least the leadership speeches.

So that's the plan. We will show a video before the main event, around 15 minutes I think. I want to share this with the leadership team - this is the third acquisition I am going through in the last 25 years, and I have not seen this kind of enthusiasm with any acquisition before. Everyone is excited and aligned.

Whether you have been through other acquisitions in your career or this is your first time, we are seeing something very unique and interesting here. I believe this is going to be very positive. We have discussed a lot about this in our previous sessions.

What I think about the growth, about the two parties working together, bringing something new - this is going to be competitive in the market. We are going to be the unmatched leader. I think as we execute, we are going to come together as a team and be the new champion in the industry.

Before we start, let's play the video from FIS leadership.

## Video Introduction/Narrator

We are here to talk about one of the most pivotal moments in technology - a moment that doesn't just reshape industries but transforms them. A moment that's a reflection of a team that's truly committed.

This isn't just a business transaction. This isn't a merger where companies are trying to figure out how to work together. This is the combination of two powerhouses that make each other better. Together, you are now stronger.

This isn't about getting bigger - it's about being better. Better for your clients, better for the market, and yes, better for each of us.

Let me tell you exactly what you're about to experience:
- **Stephanie Ferris** will discuss strategy and what the most comprehensive dataset in payments really means
- **Jim Johnson and Galen Jowers** will address how you go to market together and turn this data advantage into real value for your clients
- **Bob Tui** will talk about what you have in common culturally, how you're organizing for success, and how leadership will keep you informed throughout integration
- Then we will have a **live Q&A** with Stephanie, Jim, Galen, and Bob taking your questions

The whole scene could fall apart, but nail it and magic happens. Chemistry happens. Something bigger than the sum of its parts happens.

You're not chasing the future of banking and payments - you're creating it. And the person leading that journey is someone who saw this opportunity, who fought to make it happen, and who closed this deal ahead of schedule because she knew it was that important for FIS, for the clients we serve, and for the future you're building.

Ladies and gentlemen, whether you're here in Columbus or watching from anywhere in the world, it is my absolute honor to welcome to the stage the leader who just made the entire financial services industry sit up and take notice - someone who knows that the best way to predict the future is to build it yourself.

Please give a warm, huge welcome to CEO and President of FIS, **Stephanie Ferris**.

## Keynote Address - Stephanie Ferris, CEO and President of FIS

Good morning, good afternoon, good evening everyone. It's so great to be here.

### The Historic Moment

I stand here today celebrating what we announced last spring - bringing together the two most talented teams in the industry, processing the most comprehensive dataset in banking and payments anywhere in the world, and creating a data intelligence engine that will act as the foundation for the future of all of our products and innovations.

This is a historic moment in fintech.

We started this last year and announced it in April. We had expectations that this would take up to two years to close. **You are exceeding expectations already - we closed it in nine months**, proving that not only are these teams amazing, they can come together and get things done with a high sense of urgency.

Thank you to all of you - every single one of you who have worked relentlessly to get us to this day. Everyone who's been supporting our clients, as well as all the teams that worked around the world, all day, every day: the legal teams, the comms teams, the finance teams, the operations colleagues - all of you. It takes a team to get us here today, so thank you!

I'm broadcasting to you today from **Columbus, Georgia**. We couldn't be more excited to be here, welcoming our newest colleagues into FIS. We're not just celebrating bringing two phenomenal companies together - we're celebrating our future.

### Perfect Timing: Three Tectonic Shifts

When we announced this in April, we knew this was strategically compelling. We knew we had joint clients and that putting our products and solutions together would be competitively compelling. We knew it would advance our competitive position. We knew the financial profile was attractive.

But we didn't know then what we know now. **We didn't know there were going to be tectonic shifts** that happened from last April to today. And those tectonic shifts make the timing of our combination even more exciting.

#### Shift #1: Regulatory Environment & Growth Agenda

There is a **financial services generational change** happening. The regulatory environment around the world for banks and financial services companies has never been more growth-oriented:
- Policies that had constrained growth have been rolled back or completely eliminated
- M&A activities are restarting across the entire banking sector
- Innovation that had historically been kept out of financial services - whether digital currencies, crypto, tokenized deposits - all of these are now inside the regulatory framework, giving our banks an opportunity to bring them in and grow with them

**The bank agenda is a growth agenda.** For those of us who've worked in and around financial services our entire lives, I don't think I've ever seen something this exciting happening. It's a generational moment.

#### Shift #2: AI at Scale

We all know that AI is here, but there's a big difference happening: **It's here at scale, and banks are adopting it at pace.**

I've never seen banks adopt technology this quickly. We all know they're typically slow adopters - not this time. They are embracing AI to:
- Transform their operations
- Create better products
- Help their consumers grow and digitize

If you know anything about AI, banks have to have very big and high-quality amounts of data to deploy their AI effectively. **What you should know about this combination is that we now have the richest and most comprehensive dataset this industry has ever seen.** We are perfectly poised to help our industry with their AI endeavors.

#### Shift #3: Agentic Commerce

Agentic commerce is here, and it's going to fundamentally transform the way commerce happens. We are already deploying AI agents as consumers to go out and shop, negotiate, and ultimately pay on our behalf.

I'm so excited that at the exact same time we closed the transaction, **the two teams had already come together and announced our first agentic commerce offering** - first in industry and the only one focused on keeping banks at the center of everything around agentic commerce.

**These three tectonic shifts since April mean we closed this transaction at the exact time our customers need us.** They need unified data, they need AI capabilities, and they need agentic commerce infrastructure.

### Addressing the Elephant in the Room

While I'm super excited, I do need to address the elephant in the room. We put down our pencils on Friday afternoon and then a tweet came out from the president about a credit card cap - a 10% interest rate cap. And then other announcements followed.

What do we know? Given how rich our history is, everybody in this room and everybody around the world at this company - **what do we do when there's change? We lean in, and we turn those changes into opportunities.** We're able to sift through the noise - is it just noise, or is it a real trend?

**We'll be here for another 50 years if we keep our heads down and focused on what really creates value for customers.** The noise will fall away.

### The Numbers

Let's run the numbers:
- **56,000 employees** across 75 countries
- Processing **73 billion transactions**
- **$12.6 billion in revenue**

These are all great facts. We're big. But what I'm most proud of, and the reason why I get up every day knowing that what you do is important to the world, is: **We run nearly 12% of the world's economy across our systems.**

This is important. Communities are built on strong financial systems. Our company is at the root of that. So if you ever wake up and wonder if what you're doing is important - it's important, it matters.

### The Complete Money Lifecycle

We're the only company that moves money across the entire money lifecycle:
- **Money at rest**: sitting in core banking deposits and wealth management accounts
- **Money in motion**: moving across all of our payment rails
- **Money at work**: where companies are using our software for lending or investing

We cover the full money lifecycle. It's not just about adding more data - it's fundamentally different intelligence that we have now.

**We can see the complete customer relationship** - from your core banking account to your credit card account to your debit account to your wealth account to your investment account. We see where it sits, and we know how it's used to create value for consumers and our banks.

In a world where AI is rewriting the rules, this comprehensive view is highly differentiating.

### Why We're Excited: Strategic Advantages

**We have data that no one else has.** That's really important, but also:

- The transaction is **immediately accretive** - we make more money from the time we come together
- We're improving and increasing cash flow by **$500 million**
- Most importantly, this combination allows us to continue to invest in significantly differentiated innovations and capabilities, like our bank-centric agentic commerce solutions announced on January 9th

We have a differentiating competitive position, and **we're singularly focused on financial institutions**. We're not confused about who we are. We're not a payments company serving merchants or small businesses. We are serving financial institutions and financial services, and that helps us stay focused.

### Our Strategy Going Forward

It's simple:
1. **Lead with modern platforms** using data and AI to create differentiators inside our products
2. **Expand our ecosystem** with our build-buy-partner strategy
3. **Do all of this with massive investments** back into our business that we're already making in 2026

#### AI Investments for 2026

- **$100 million** invested across our entire product stack to deliver differentiated AI-enabled capabilities
- **$30 million** in our client experience to make client outcomes better
- **$20 million** in all of you - to improve your colleague experience and make sure you have the skills necessary to work for the world's leading financial technology company

We need to make sure that you as well are AI-enabled. These are humongous amounts of investments going on this year that will continue, and that's what this combination enables us to do.

#### Build-Buy-Partner Strategy

We're also the only company actively and strategically executing on a build-buy-partner strategy:

**Building**: Fantastic products developed internally

**Buying**: Talented teams and differentiated products including:
- The issuing solutions business (TSYS)
- Dragonfly
- Detroit
- Everlink
- Amount
And those are just the ones we did in 2024-2025

**Partnering**: Strategic partnerships with ecosystem players like:
- Circle
- Zafin
- Arc
- Llama AI
- Sardine

The combination of all of this - putting AI in our own products, buying best-in-class products, and partnering with strategic companies and integrating all of that together - **is truly differentiating in the marketplace**. There isn't one competitor that can say they're doing more.

### Employee Enablement

We've activated every single employee within FIS with AI technology. For the TSYS team who just got here, yours is coming soon. We need to make sure we are investing in all of you, and you need to make sure you're taking advantage of all the technology and tools we provide.

### Closing

We're just starting to unlock the possibilities we have together. The foundation is set. The investments are made. **The opportunity is ours. This is our moment. Now, let's go seize it.**

Thank you!

## Local Leadership Closing Remarks

Thank you so much and please don't leave yet. We are going to have a cake cutting ceremony, and then we'll break for lunch. During lunch, the leadership team will come and join us so you have more interactions. I hope you would also like to take some photographs.

Thank you again for being here. Let's give them one more round of applause!

## Technology Leadership Address - [Name]

**[Speaking to India/Philippines teams]**

Hello everyone! Thank you again for the warm welcome. When I met with the leadership this morning, we got an early glimpse of all the great work all of you do. But more importantly, I want to welcome you to your other colleagues on behalf of the entire organization.

### The Scale and Impact

Stephanie talked about **56,000 people globally**. **45% of the workforce is based in India** - I want to let that sink in. It's not about the number or the size, it's about the impact.

I've been with FIS for two years - I joined in 2024. I hadn't worked in financial services before, having worked in other industries. I didn't have an appreciation for what it takes as a consumer. We take it for granted - your bank account, your cards, all these things. But I've been learning to appreciate what it takes to do this at scale. That's something FIS has taught me, and I'm looking forward to learning about all the work that you do as well.

### The Money Lifecycle

The money lifecycle is very important - money at rest, money in motion, and money at work. The good news is that many of our core systems, our engineering teams, are in India. Professional services deployment teams, customer experience teams - people who run much of our CX work are based here.

**This is a great learning opportunity.** If you want to learn about FIS, India is the place to come. I tell that to our leadership team - whenever they come here, they note that India is the only place where we can talk about an entire customer lifecycle end to end.

I'm looking forward to having TSYS join my leadership team, because that's the table where we can talk about everything:
- How we scale
- What our product management leaders see in the market
- Technology development insights from people who've been advising for many years
- Real customer stories on implementations
- Lessons learned
- Modernization perspectives across banks and financial institutions

We work with **3,000 banks and 16,000 financial institutions** to keep their lights on and their business running. That's an immense amount of responsibility.

### Strategic Focus Areas

As you start onboarding into FIS systems, Stephanie talked about a lot of areas. For me, two key areas stand out:

**1. Data at Scale**
What do we do with the scale of data you're bringing in, and how do we unlock it for our customers and their benefit?

**2. AI Enablement**
How do we enable AI at scale and allow us to actually build AI into our products, into the way we operate, and make sense of agentic commerce for the company?

### Investments in You

Stephanie talked about investing over $100 million in our products for AI enhancement. We are also:
- Bringing in a large amount of money to uplevel AI skills across the company
- Giving you the tools you need

We deployed **GitHub Copilot** to all colleagues just a few months ago. Across the engineering teams, we now have **90%+ adoption of Copilot**, and we're tracking **10-15% uplift in effectiveness of engineering teams** using GitHub Copilot. We also have access to Claude and other tools.

As you come on board, you'll start getting access to those tools as well. It's not just about using it in your day job - it's also about learning and experimenting so you can use it more effectively.

### Culture of Openness

We, as the India leadership, believe that **openness and transparency is the way to work**. I'm glad to see that kind of culture here as well in the TSYS team. We want everybody to have access to leadership to ask questions. **No question is off limits.**

You will get all the answers you're looking for. And one thing - if you ask me a question, I may ask you a question back, so be ready!

Welcome to all of you. I'm very excited. This level of scale and excitement - I have not seen this around acquisitions before. I'm truly excited to be welcoming all of you, and also us joining you. It's not just you coming in - it's also our journey together. We become one team.

Thank you!

## HR Leadership Address - [HR Leader]

Good morning! It's an honor to be here and I'm very excited because this is a big step for all of us as well.

### Compensation and Benefits - Nothing Is Changing

Before we get into questions, I want to address this upfront because I don't want us to lose time having this doubt in our minds:

**NOTHING IN COMPENSATION IS CHANGING RIGHT NOW:**
- **Payroll is not changing**
- **Benefits are not changing**
- **Compensation is not changing**

We have teams from HR and integration specialists to take care of all of these separately. As we move toward integration, some of the administration things might change, some elements might change, but **not to the disadvantage of anyone**.

Advanced notice and information will be communicated. I don't want anyone stressed about this so that we can spend quality time getting to explore each other's approaches and methodologies.

### New Opportunities

The real opportunity I see is that a new world is open for both organizations. More importantly, you now have avenues open to work with thousands of colleagues in India itself and many more globally. There are many more learning opportunities coming.

**That's what I want us to focus on** - rather than worrying about elements of compensation or benefits that are not changing.

Thank you and welcome once again!

## Q&A Session

**Moderator:** Thank you so much for giving all these questions to us. This is going to give a lot of clarity and help us be more confident about the future.

### Q1: What is the future of TSYS Prime platform and products as part of FIS?

**Answer (Leadership Team):**

If you look at FIS performance, attrition is one of the areas we track - somewhere between 16-18% annually, which is one of the lowest you can see in this kind of industry. So attrition is low, and joining FIS definitely gives you local peace and stability.

There are many clients using TSYS products like Prime as their primary platform. There are definitely possibilities to cross-sell and upsell. This is one of the most exciting opportunities our business team is looking forward to.

**From Technology Perspective:**
I can't speak to the Prime platform specifically, but I'll tell you - the excitement of running the two organizations together was truly from the aspect of **adding strength to strength**. It was not about acquiring to sunset products. It's really about two companies coming together for the strengths they bring.

We work with about **3,000 bank customers and 16,000+ financial institutions** around the world. When you look at the customer journey, there is nobody better at this point than FIS at being able to look across the customer relationship with an institution and bring back insights from a data perspective.

I imagine our top 100 customers buy an average of 30+ products from FIS today, without what TSYS brings. **This has become one more very key part of the sales relationship** - what can we do more of with products performing this well?

We work across the entire spectrum:
- **LFIs** (Large Financial Institutions) - trillion-dollar banks
- **Super regional banks** - very strong relationships
- **Regional banks**
- **Community banks**

We have relationships across all segments. What this kind of combination does is just build on the scale and trust that we continue to build with our customers, at a time when they're also struggling with data challenges.

### Q2: How does India's role fit into FIS's strategic vision? What are the key technology priorities post-acquisition?

**Answer (Technology Leadership):**

First of all, **I don't look at India as a delivery center**. I talk about India as having impact. What kind of impact are we driving together for the business, for the customers, and for each other?

You're joining a company where already **45% of the company is based in India**. There is no question in anyone's mind that India is a strategic center for FIS. I wouldn't be here at this level if it wasn't.

**The Challenge I Give Each One of You:**
In your own function - whether it's engineering, implementation, HR, whatever - ask yourself: **What impact am I bringing to the company on a daily basis that aligns with the outcomes we want to achieve?**

If you're able to answer that, you're in the right place. That's what I wake up every day thinking about:
- How does it align with corporate priorities?
- How does it align with my unit's goals?
- How does it align with functional priorities?
- How does it align with my personal growth and learning?

If you can do that, fantastic things will happen.

### Q3: Will there be changes to benefits, learning platforms, salary calendars?

**Answer (HR):**

As already mentioned - **nothing is changing right now**. Whatever you have, you continue to have. As we integrate over the next couple of months, if there are any changes:
- Advanced notice will be given
- Communication will be thorough
- It will be done to ensure we get the best outcomes

**On Learning Platforms:**
We use the Udemy platform for learning. We have a portal - I'm not sure how many have accessed the FIS intranet site yet, but most FAQ questions are answered there.

On **Pluralsight**, we have more than **20,000 learning opportunities** available for everyone. We have connections with Pluralsight and Udemy. What you need to focus on is: if some content you want to learn is not available, raise it.

**HR Support Center:**
You don't need to wait to ask someone directly. There is an HR support center - AI is changing the way we work, so we are undergoing transformation in how we support employees as well. You don't need to wait for your answers.

Raise your questions on the HR support center, and within 24 hours you will get an answer. That's my request to everybody - start raising your questions on the HR support center rather than waiting for someone to come and answer.

**Learning Team Alignment:**
Our learning team works closely with engineering and other teams. We're starting a whole series on **AI in the SDLC** (Software Development Lifecycle) - looking at it from product management, engineering, professional services, the entire spectrum. We're putting together coursework around this that will get rolled out.

If there's something very specific that you don't find on Pluralsight, our learning team is constantly evaluating what we have. It's not because they haven't thought about it - we work very closely to identify gaps and add content.

### Q4: Will term insurance be provided by FIS like it was at TSYS?

**Answer (HR):**

Yes, we also have insurance benefits. You should go through all of them to understand. We have flexibility in all our insurance - there are different tiers/cards that you can select.

If there are any changes in administration (maybe the broker, etc.), that will be informed in advance.

### Q5: Will there be impacts on employee perks and bonuses?

**Answer (HR):**

We have a global compensation and benefits team that is currently studying the structure that TSYS has and made adjustments as needed during integration.

We also have a variable component - there's a base and there's a variable. All of that follows the same structure. **We are studying integration, and in case there is a change, it will be communicated.** I do not see any major changes happening, but depending on role, level, profile, and fitment, if there are changes, HR will communicate them clearly.

---

## Floor Questions

### Q6: Does FIS encourage people to enroll in courses outside of training schedules, and do they get reimbursed?

**Answer (Leadership):**

**Yes, we do have this.** For business-relevant courses and conference attendance, we do allow people to use reimbursement mechanisms.

There's an annual cap, and it's at managerial discretion to approve or not approve, but if you are within the cap and it's for a relevant course that is approved by your manager, you can get reimbursement.

### Q7: What are the opportunities to learn about other products or move to different portfolios?

**Answer (Technology Leadership):**

We have multiple avenues:

**Learning Opportunities:**
- **Tech Expo** events
- **Innovation forums**
- Ability for people to reach out and learn about different parts of the business

**Job Rotation:**
If you're looking for a job rotation and want to move from one part of the business to another, **internal job postings** are one mechanism to make that visibility available across the company.

We encourage people to learn other functions. We want to promote cross-functional learning and movement.

### Q8: Where are we currently on AI and agentic commerce? What's the roadmap?

**Answer (Technology Leadership):**

Let me give you my perspective on the possibilities of agentic commerce and how TSYS and FIS together are building this.

**Investment:** We're investing **$100 million** across all our business lines in AI capabilities.

**Example Projects:**

**Smart Basket:**
One project called Smart Basket is about bringing together the ability to suggest to a consumer what payment instrument they can use at checkout - whether digitally or in a real-world retail shop. We suggest incentives to the customer at the point of sale so they can choose which payment method to use and be incentivized for it.

The power of something like that requires:
- The history of the customer
- The partnerships behind it
- We're building all of those components

**Platform Approach - Three Layers:**

**1. Data Layer:**
Bringing together data from various sources, hydrating data from our operating data stores. We have a lot of data sitting in various systems - we're bringing that together and doing data unification.

**2. Model Layer:**
My team owns model building. We are building classes of models around different use cases.

*Example:* Credit card/debit card optimization - if we know someone is using their debit card for payments, we can suggest they use a credit card instead for rewards or other benefits. This we could not have done in the past without TSYS data coming together with FIS data.

We're looking at:
- Wealth data
- Core banking data
- Payments data (we process 12% of global commerce)

The challenge we had in the past was: how do you bring it all together and make it make sense? Now we can.

**3. Agent Layer:**
Once we've built the models (some available, some we bring in, some we build), we then open up the agent layers - how do we open up the models so people can build interesting applications on top of them.

**Agent Marketplace:**
We want to be able to build this out so we don't have everybody building different agents of the same kind. We want people to contribute agents to a marketplace. If you're building something in your area, somebody in capital markets who wants to do something very similar doesn't have to go and rebuild it.

**This is work in progress. If you have ideas, come talk to me.** There are a lot of learning opportunities, and even this morning in the leadership conversation, I've already identified two or three areas where I can immediately start partnering with other leaders in India on work they were already doing.

## Closing Remarks

**Moderator:** Thank you so much. You may have a lot more questions, and there will be many more opportunities to have these kinds of interactions.

We have limited time now, so please join us if you haven't already. We're going to do the cake cutting ceremony next.

Thank you all for being here and welcome to the FIS family!
