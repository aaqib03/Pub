I do want to just make sure that there's some annotation that there is still ongoing communication between the GP and immigration teams and FIS immigration teams. 

At this point, there's no actions that are to be taken. 

Um, all team members that are within a status space in the U.S for visas at the communicated with or release of Um Of their documents early to the attorneys.

19:41
Ever. 

There was a time to look really good. 

There should be no disruption to your day-to-day work. 

Okay, if you get a sub-one or you get a major resident, please engage as quickly as possible. 

This is where we, We know how to run our business. 

This is the time we want to show off that we know how to run our business? 

So, um, if you flip to the next slide, we So I want to talk about day one, and there's been a lot of questions. 

Like, what is day one? 

So, day one Is the same thing as the closing date of this deal. 

It's the day that everybody acknowledges that we are officially a part of FIS, and we're not there yet. 

And I know there's been a little bit of confusion as to what day one is, and when we are considered to be FS, but you won't know until you're told that We are now part of FIS, um, unfortunately, that day one. 

Um, we communicated it that it's part of, uh, that it will close in q1. 

We know it'll be early January, but we don't have a publicly available date to announce to all team members, so no, that's frustrated, frustrating for you. 

But um, just know, we're all in this together. 

And um, when, when that day one comes, you'll you will be communicated to. 

Okay, so, um, most of these changes that are going to take, take place in what you experience is going to be behind the scenes, and it's going to be in kind of some phased approach. 

All of this information is in the FAQs. 

All of this information is in the FAQs, But we wanted to first share that from HR perspective. 

We do acknowledge there's two kind of camps. 

There are those countries that are immediately Are upon day one will be under FIS HR care, and there are those countries that will still be under global payments. 

HR care for a period of time up to four months. 

Okay, so just recognize kind of where you're at in both camps, but you're still part of this day. 

One Journey, Your Global payments access the things that you need to do your job every day. 

You're going to access the same system you're going to be on the the tsus land. 

You're going to be on the GP network. 

You're going to have the same access that you've had before. 

There is a little Little bit of a unique shift we're going to be if you're in this immediate FIS HR category. 

So, there's going to be a little identifier next to our names that are going to say see thesis. 

So, there's going to be a little identifier next to our names that are going to say, see thesis. 

Um, it's really important, and it's legally. 

For those Team members that? 

For those Team members that are in the temporary HR continuation, you'll still be tagged as thesis for this period of time. 

And for those that are A contractor with Tsus, but not yet ready to flip, you'll also be tagged as a contractor thesis. 

So, just wanted to share that if you see that being different, there is a this is in the FAQ. 

Um, there's recommendation that you clear your cache in Google so that the names display properly. 

So, just take a look at that and just I want you to be aware of that and not be like, oh my gosh, what does this mean? 

So, um, if you have any questions, feel free to ask. 

But this is all behind the scenes. 

Not a big deal. 

Global payments access. 

There are some things that we're not going to be allowed to see anymore. 

That's because we are no longer part of local payments, and so there's some confidential information that exists like in the Archer system or within some total or impersipio. 

Um, there's some things like that. 

That will change, Make my got a little bit of lag going on. 

Um, so please don't let it freeze on some awkward facial view, um, so, so no, um. 

There may be a little bit of a access removal if you have any questions about that. 

Let us know. 

Um, if you lose access or you see some disruption that impacts you or Being performing your job, call the help desk call the sort of the global Service desk like you would normally follow the same channels that you normally would do not delay. 

Do not let this any of these changes. 

Cause any delay in you. 

Being able to perform your work And then the last part is around FIS access. 

So, all team members that are going to be conveying all issuing team members that are going to be going over to FIS. 

They'll gain access to FIS workday. 

Um, they're going to have access to Microsoft on the FIS system, and they'll have access to Outlook and teams on the FIS system, and this process actually started yesterday. 

Um, there's a deployment that's taking place to your laptops. 

It's called Island browser. 

It's the interim solution on how we'll have a window into FIS and communication emails are being sent out starting today to notify you on how to prepare to gain that access. 

You'll have an additional RSA token that you'll need to create, and you'll have some credentials that you'll set up, and there's some time sensitivity around that. 

So, please watch for those emails. 

Um, so the big takeaway from The slide is there should be no disruption to your day-to-day work, right Next, slidely. 

So, this is just a little bit of, um, the what I can do to prepare, right? 

And I just want to make sure read the FAQs, you'll get this deck you can click here. 

There's an FAQ, they continue to update this FAQ as there's new information available. 

This is the same place that it goes into benefits. 

This goes to entangled team members, and there are several Technology questions that are embedded in this FAQ, so read it. 

If you're a leader, read it and make sure your team members understand what that means. 

And please ask questions. 

You have to be engaged, so this is the way we want to start our new year. 

Ali, right? 

We want to be engaged. 

We want to lean forward. 

We want to be active, and so we set up some new chat channels, or we had some existing chat channels. 

For issuer Technology, we just um, blew them up, right? 

So, we've added all of our leadership into an issuerer technology leadership space That includes all of the new leaders across the GTS organization that are going into FIS, and then, and from the pmo office. 

And then, we also have an all team member space. 

If you're not in those please, Um, let us know, Uh, we did it the best we could. 

Based on the census and a perimeter list that we had. 

So, There's a lot of chatter in that, and I think that's okay. 

That just shows that our team members are Are actively engaged. 

They're reading the material they have questions. 

Please be a part of the solution. 

I don't use it as a complaining space, but I think it's really good and an opportunity to say, oh, my gosh, have you seen this? 

And what does this mean? 

Um, and a reminder if you have any issues, call the global service desk. 

I would ask our endpoint teams really excited because they're all part of this journey also, but we have durrendra and India. 

We've got George Zavos and Cyprus. 

We've got the, Uh Chris Grant and Grant Aflat and the UK and Cliff Brown, although they may be some of those guys may be shifting later. 

They are all fully a part of this journey and are testing out the endpoint, um, Activities that are going on, so they're available to help support you guys as you need. 

Um, and then there's this thing called hyperpare. 

This isn't our first rodeo, you know, so we know what it means to have hyper Care in place. 

We know what it means to have a war room. 

We know what it means to have a go Readiness call, and so there's hypercare support that is in place to make sure that we have brake glass opportunities to make sure we reinstate anything that may be lost. 

KPMG will have a man Bridge Line. 

We're going to have FIS team members from their endpoint teams partnering up with our own folks, um, is specifically in in various sites in India in the UK and the U.S to make sure that we have the support that we need. 

I've included two snapshots of the email in this slide, the main Thing, and thank you, Scott McIntosh, for pointing this out. 

We want to make sure that you see this come across as an authorized email, and this is a communication that you're going to get from FIS to say, set up your credentials and, um, and be prepared to have access to your information and FIS. 

When that day one comes All right, that's all I have there. 

Thanks, Lee. 

Thanks to Laker. 

There are roadmap a plan for day one day two, that kind of thing. 

That kind of thing, Oh sure, yeah, Um, there are. 

That kind of thing, Oh sure. 

Yeah, Um, there are actually quite a bit of activities that had already started few months ago to identify worthy integration opportunities will take place. 

Many of our existing applications and services are being considered as Leaders and in a space of integration And the the business and the product teams on both sides, Um, have been engaged at a level to identify which features from what service, Um, to be combined. 

Um, I expect to start seeing some of that and sharing with our teams. 

Um, I expect to start seeing some of that and sharing with our teams, Probably within four to six weeks after day one. 

Okay, Next one is for Kim. 

You touched on the access for our team members, you know, we want to retain access. 

The question really expanded on. 

What about client access as testing been done for our clients and the question specifically around pieces Prime? 

Zero change to the way our clients interact with us. 

They're going to come through the same channels that they've come through today. 

The authentication is not going to change. 

There's zero access changes to our customers or our clients in the way that they work on the platforms that we're in. 

I think somebody had even asked about as a developer. 

I can't wait to start working in the FIS Environment. 

You're not going to be working in the FIS environment. 

You're going to be working in the GP environment, exactly the same way that you work today. 

So there's zero changes that are taking place in regards to how we interface with our customers, our clients um and and there this. 

This will be a this will be a process that I just want to make sure that everybody kind of feels that it's going to be like one of those big booms. 

Oh, it's day one and nothing. 

Nothing really changes. 



19:52
You just go feel a little bit different, and we're going to be really excited about it, but the way that you do your job day to day, it should be like. 

Is a non-event, and it's really, really important that our customers feel it as a non-event, and they don't feel like there's any distractions, and they don't feel like that there's any. 

We don't know what we're doing. 

We just need to make sure that we've got our Ducks growing, know exactly how to engage, and we continue to show them that top level service. 

Okay, Next set of questions. 

We're moving to Lake a rapid fire around, So the question, there's two questions around Banks at sick time. 

What's going to happen to teach the bank sick time? 

So, most of all, PTO time, including being sick time, will be pull through and acknowledge by FIS. 

However, they did state that there's going to be more information that they're going to have as a part of, Um, you know, the time framework, the switchover as a part of that. 

But as um, as it's been noted, there won't be any change to any time difference they will be. 

I'll take an actor. 

Okay, All right. 

Next question is around your favorite FSA cards with a global payments. 

I know there's a lot of discussion going on the chat out there. 

Is there official word on what our team members us? 

His team members should be able to do or Elder, um, I. 

One of the good things as that we've been trying to take this up to to as high as the point that we can again, Um, the GP HR team is very limited on what we have access to to know from FIS. 

However, we have Rocky's concerns up to our GP benefits team, and so they have responded again. 

They will be addressing those questions as their facilitating for that facial or specific FAQ that you guys will be receiving next week. 

So, there should be more information with regards to What that looks like in process. 

For those who are On a FSA. 

If you want to go to a HSA for FIS, I'm also for Details as a part of what that looks like for how that process of transfer will be. 

If there's any tax implication bins And such and so forth. 

So, again early next week, we should have more effort answers and details as a part of those things Paid to like it. 

Real quick on the HSA thing. 

I did read the there is material in the benefits, um, FAQ on HSA. 

So if you have an HSA, you're going to an HSA. 

There's information. 

Go read that. 

I think that issue was more, Um, if the day one happens into the year, and I have my son's getting his wisdom teeth taken out on the 5th, and we don't become FIS until the 10th. 

Can I use my FSA? 

What's the? 

What's the implications of that. 

I'm just saying that out loud, because that's a lot of the chatter and that, and that chat group. 

And that's, that's where FIS is saying they can't respond as kind of GP to help us. 

And so, um, it is a little bit clunky, so we appreciate patience on that. 

I think there's a lot of people who've said you can still go in and change your Global payments FSA to to cancel your FSA for next year. 

Um, I've had a couple people reach out. 

You are a global global Payments employee until you're not, so use your Global payments insurance. 

If you have any appointments or anything up until the day of day one, your Global payments when we say, hey, it's day one you should buy that point in time. 

Have an FIS insurance card in your hand, so I just want to make sure everybody kind of hears that. 

So I add, and very once. 

My girl is going to say the same thing, and again, you are a global payments and on global payments assurance until the switch happens. 

So, if there is anything as a part of this kind of in between time, we do know that there hasn't been a specific date That has the communicated. 

As of now, please don't think that after the 1st of Jan that there's no change or there's changes as a part of that. 

You are still covered. 

However, as it aligns to the FSA to HSA or cross HSHA, Uh, please, please, please ensure that you're communicating there with HR, preferably first with those team member benefits centers because we want to make sure that you're engaging with them, Um, to make sure that that transfer Of on clients or rollover is happening as they be. 

So, again, we will be having the benefits team enroll for those specific GP, Um, facilitated questions as a part of that. 

And as you guys are also working through your benefit selections and contributions as a part of your effort, Fiest FSA 25 times fast. 

So, thank you And we get a few more out there. 

So, the next question is around somebody. 

Apparently, some of our team members received at Cobra letter. 

Do we know why and what to do Or not, right? 

Um, so this is a Fis ability Affiliated Document as a part of the ERSA, Um, that um team members will more more than likely receive. 

After they enroll, It's really just a standard information letter, just confirming that you have been enrolled in a plan. 

And that plan is the eligible for certain types of benefits, so it is a legal notice. 

I don't know actions that are needed as a part of that, and it's not affiliate it with your current, Um, GP benefits, but more of a standard document of of Rights as a part of your FIS benefits enrollment. 

I mean, next question, are there any stocks trade restrictions out there? 

Black Operates per team. 

I do think that there are some details that have been noted within the um. 

I do think that there are some details that have been noted within the um FAQs and the benefits Same as a part of that. 

But, as of blackouts, we haven't been notified or communicated to as a part of that. 

First, question is, when will a payroll? 

Uh, well, one way they call us a payroll calendar. 

So, uh, you know what our pay days are on. 

Are they going to? 

Are they planning on publishing that, or you have the information what our paydays are, Where FIS, no, that probably will be provided in a separate email to those team members who wants to close date is, and those conversions have occurred for paying role for 2026, those on dates, and that time schedule is available within Team GP. 

Okay, And just to add to that paint roll, it was in the FAQ of issuing separation within FIS, how they do their payroll. 

It's the fifth things in the last processing day, business day of the month. 

So don't know when we'll convert over to FIS, but that is the the times. 

Yeah, my bi-monthly, yeah, that was mentioned, but I think some people are not clear if that's right answers. 

Okay, all right. 

Next question is around, uh, is there a plan to go back and look at all of our titles and look at, You know, what jobs we do, job families, and that kind of thing within FRS. 

Fis has finalized their new job architecture, and we will be going through a good job mapping. 

Fis has finalized their new job architecture, and we will be going through a good job mapping, Um activities, in the first couple of weeks. 

And so stay tuned to All right. 

We have two more all groupies together, the next one, I guess. 

Maybe talik, this is around the, uh, H1B Visa and green card process. 

Can you address? 

There's quite a few questions about they're all asking around that. 

The process in West Germany or anything is going to change. 

Yeah, so the process as a part of what that's going to look like, for, for those persons who are on visa status, is still in communication between the attorneys between, um, the immigration attorneys between that FIS and with Global. 

However, Um, there has not been any. 

They will not be any change as a part of what that looks like for their process. 

What they are currently working through is assuring that all team members are, Um, transfer it over to the proper change. 

So, the new attorneys from Fias, as well as making sure that the changes and those applicable changes to their business status, are aligned. 

Um, as of now, they do have the files for every team member that's an impact as a part of that. 

Look over the last couple of weeks. 

They have received a consent, Um, email that allows for FIS Immigration attorneys to have access to those files prior to close. 

Um, the status and reviews are going on as of right now and then. 

Once there is a completed or The clothes is being confirmed, and they will then be able to start communicating. 

So, I'm no actions. 

As of now, you've done the part that you need to do by being able to consent for them to release your files over. 

Um, you will have that entry Access to farm, and I believe has been of the immigration team for Raphais To provide during next step, so some coming as soon as they're able to announce on to closing The next group of questions. 

There's five related to. 

What are India office strategy is between Noah and, Um, I haven't informed that there is any office changes that are occurring as of now, so we do want to advise for For the team members to look at it as a BAU until updated information is provided. 

So, as we've been kind of as Kim's kind of noted, we're having this really big change, and it's you look around. 

You're like, it looks pretty much the same. 

Um, there is a VA kind of stay in place as a part of what this looks like for a strategy, at least as we're working through the first piece of the transition, Um, added. 

More communication is provided through after close again. 

There will be tons of details that will be able to be released. 

Um, and any decisions that FIS has as a part of what that looks like and change will be commuted. 

Uh, addressed all the questions around. 

Thank you! 

Can I wish everyone happy New Year? 

And let's move on strong to the transition state. 

Thank you everyone! 

Thanks, Ell!
