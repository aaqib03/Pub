Excellent ‚Äî let‚Äôs now go one level deeper:
I'll extract scenario-based questions directly from the candidate's resume, so you or any interviewer can probe into what exactly the person has done.

After each question, I‚Äôll give a model answer (based on what their resume suggests).
Here‚Äôs the markdown version:

Scenario-Based Questions & Answers from Resume


---

1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Deployment & High Availability

Q:

You mentioned deploying internal applications like SUCHI on AWS with high availability and minimal downtime.
üëâ Can you explain how you architected the deployment and achieved high availability?

A:

For SUCHI application:

Deployed using EC2 instances in multiple AZs for high availability.

Used Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic.

Auto Scaling Group (ASG) was configured to automatically scale based on CPU utilization.

RDS Multi-AZ was used for database HA.

Implemented CloudWatch alarms and dashboards for proactive monitoring.

Used CodePipeline for zero-downtime deployments.

Rollbacks were automated using deployment hooks when health checks failed.



---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Proactive Downtime Prevention

Q:

You mentioned proactively reducing downtime by identifying issues beforehand.
üëâ Can you explain what kind of monitoring or alerting mechanisms you put in place to achieve this?

A:

Configured CloudWatch alarms for CPU, memory, disk usage, and application-level metrics.

Integrated with SNS to receive instant notifications.

Used CloudTrail for auditing API activity.

Integrated GuardDuty for security threat detection.

Implemented centralized logging using CloudWatch Logs for log aggregation.

Created custom metrics and dashboards in Grafana.

Regularly analyzed logs and metrics to identify bottlenecks or abnormal patterns.



---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Secret Management Automation

Q:

You automated AWS Secrets Manager secret rotation.
üëâ Can you explain how you implemented this automation?

A:

Used AWS Secrets Manager rotation feature.

Configured Lambda functions to rotate secrets (database credentials, API keys) automatically.

The Lambda function fetched new credentials, updated RDS/MySQL database, and rotated credentials securely.

Updated application IAM roles to access secrets at runtime.

Monitored rotation logs using CloudWatch to ensure smooth operation.

This helped avoid manual rotation and prevented credential leaks.



---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Disaster Recovery Planning

Q:

How did you ensure your application deployments were disaster recovery (DR) ready?

A:

Deployed resources across multiple Availability Zones for fault isolation.

Maintained backup strategies for RDS (automated snapshots).

Used S3 Cross-Region Replication for critical object storage.

Implemented Route 53 failover routing policies.

Regularly conducted DR drills to verify RTO and RPO objectives.

Infrastructure was defined using Terraform for quick reproducibility.



---

5Ô∏è‚É£ AWS CodePipeline Setup

Q:

You designed and deployed CodePipeline with CodeCommit and CodeBuild.
üëâ Can you walk me through your CI/CD pipeline design?

A:

Developers pushed code into CodeCommit repositories.

CodePipeline was triggered on every commit.

CodeBuild performed build, unit testing, and security scans.

Upon successful build, deployment artifacts were created.

Deployed to ECS (for containerized apps) or EC2 (for legacy apps) using CodeDeploy.

Integrated approval stages before production deployment.

Notifications were sent via SNS for pipeline status.



---

6Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting Production Incidents

Q:

Can you give an example of a production issue you troubleshooted successfully?

A:

Faced sudden latency spikes in one application.

CloudWatch logs showed increased DB connection errors.

Identified that new deployment introduced connection leaks.

Rolled back deployment via CodePipeline.

Scaled RDS read replicas temporarily to handle backlog.

Root cause was identified as improper DB pool size configuration.

Post-mortem was documented, and pipeline test cases were enhanced to catch similar issues early.



---

7Ô∏è‚É£ Cost Optimization Efforts

Q:

You optimized AWS costs.
üëâ What concrete steps did you take to achieve cost savings?

A:

Used AWS Compute Optimizer to right-size EC2 instances.

Shifted development workloads to spot instances wherever applicable.

Used S3 Lifecycle policies and Intelligent-Tiering to optimize storage cost.

Decommissioned unused EBS volumes, ELBs, and orphaned snapshots.

Used Savings Plans for predictable workloads.

Built cost dashboards in AWS Cost Explorer to track spend.



---

8Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure Automation with Terraform

Q:

How did you use Terraform to automate your infrastructure provisioning?

A:

Created modularized Terraform code for reusable components (VPC, EC2, ALB, RDS, etc.).

Managed state remotely using S3 and DynamoDB locking.

Followed GitOps model to manage Terraform changes via pull requests.

Used Terraform Workspaces to separate environments (dev, staging, prod).

Automated provisioning of IAM roles, security groups, ALBs, and VPC peering.

Implemented Terraform drift detection using periodic terraform plan runs.



---

9Ô∏è‚É£ Collaboration with Developers

Q:

You mentioned collaboration with dev teams for microservices deployment.
üëâ How did you ensure smooth DevOps enablement for development teams?

A:

Built shared CI/CD pipelines that developers could reuse.

Standardized Docker image build process.

Created Helm charts (for Kubernetes workloads).

Trained developers on writing infrastructure specs using Terraform modules.

Set up Dev/QA sandboxes for isolated testing.

Maintained documentation and playbooks to guide developers.



---

üîü AWS Security Hardening

Q:

What AWS security hardening practices did you follow?

A:

Implemented least privilege IAM roles.

Enabled MFA for console and privileged access.

Used KMS encryption for all storage (S3, EBS, RDS).

Enabled AWS Config to track resource changes.

Deployed GuardDuty for threat detection.

Regularly rotated secrets via Secrets Manager.

Applied Security Hub standards (CIS Benchmarks) to monitor compliance.

‚úÖ Done


---

This gives you a deep dive scenario pack ‚Äî directly mapped to resume responsibilities.


---

üëâ If you say yes, I can also prepare:

A "drill-down interview file": combining both scenario + theory.

A cheat-sheet markdown you can directly keep for live interviews.

A mock interview set for practice.


Shall I prepare that as well? üî•
