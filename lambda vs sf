Introduction

This document compares two architectures for transferring files to a remote SFTP server:

1. Lambda-Based Approach: Uses AWS Lambda to initiate API calls to the AWS SFTP Connector.


2. Step Function-Based Approach: Uses AWS Step Functions to orchestrate Lambda executions and retries systematically.



We evaluate performance, batch processing, failure handling, monitoring, and scalability to help determine the best approach.

Analysis & Recommendations

Use the Lambda-Based Approach when:

âœ… High-volume, real-time processing is required.
âœ… Parallel execution and batch processing via SQS is needed.
âœ… Low-latency, event-driven execution is a priority.
âœ… You want direct API calls without overhead from Step Functions.

Use the Step Function-Based Approach when:

âœ… Orchestrated workflows with strict execution order are needed.
âœ… File transfer state tracking and visibility is a key requirement.
âœ… You need built-in retries, error handling, and monitoring.
âœ… Batch processing with sequential steps (encryption, logging) is required.

Conclusion

Both architectures are scalable and reliable, but they serve different needs:

For high-throughput, batch processing with automatic retries â†’ Lambda + SQS is the best choice.

For structured workflows requiring strict execution sequencing and monitoring â†’ Step Functions are better.

Next Steps

If real-time, scalable processing is needed â†’ Deploy Lambda + SQS.

If controlled execution and logging visibility are key â†’ Use Step Functions.
