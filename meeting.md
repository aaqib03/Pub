Sure that there's a couple of things, but that's a good starting place. 

I know updating our Ingress models. 

I know there's been some, Um, I guess. 

Technology Releases from AWS as far as our Ingress pattern, so we need to review them As a team as well, Like an interested in. 

What's the front end AWS Cloud Front? 

Well for delivery. 

They're going to hit U.S West or U.S West, one. 

They're going to hit U.S West or U.S West one, And then that would write them that they would use the AWS backbone. 

So pretty much. 

It has a I guess you say like a load balancer, But it's on. 

It's on AWF data. 

The DIY do a cloudfront of the refrigera to try and? 

The DIY do a cloudfront of the refrigera to try and Speeding a bit on sea stars. 

Yeah, yeah, we. 

We did some with the landing or with the uh outage page, which we, that's something else that will have to follow up and deploy. 

Um, So we've got a familiar with it a little bit, um, as far as reading on it. 

And you know, researching Cloud front? 

Also, the the DNS that they release the global DNS? 

Also, the the DNS that they release the global DNS, Um, one of the main things is. 

I mean, I know, we have the Lambda function today that does our fell over. 

Um, But I don't think that's that's needed anymore, so we can take a look at that as well, whether that comes from us or Stratus, But those are the name. 

If you either way, don't point being is, we'll get together as a team, and we'll kind of go through. 

I'll start off with, like a starting point, and then we can continue and grow that list of goals from the year. 

Um, what we expect you to accomplish? 

Sounds good. 

So, so the homework areas guys is The research. 

Think about it, you know, and like I said, we'll set up a meeting in any improvements that you can see in monitoring in our Cloud infrastructure. 

In our Ingress egress, I know they were they. 

They've got a firewall proxy now, um, that they came out with this. 

Well, AWS has, so that's something that we can look at as well. 

Eating POCS. 

You guys want to do, But that's a T9. 

Or, you know, shared Dev? 

Um, that's something we can look at. 

Um, so just, I guess, the homework there is to think about that in, You know, come have a list of items you're ready to discuss, Uh, make sure you participate in in the media as well. 

I will call on. 

People make sure that everybody's participating. 

And Andreas been looking at the fireworkcoxic features. 

So, yeah, nothing was talking about. 

Did you mention technical debt in that list? 

No, I did. 

We could go through some of that as well. 

All we have is technical bet honestly, besides What? 

All we have is technical bet honestly. 

Besides, What I, what I would like to do, I know one thing, and that's all worked with you on, is, you know, we have this huge. 

Spreadsheet, or or Document, with all of our Ingress egress designs. 

Yeah, you know, we got. 

You can kind of consolidate that stringent, simplified a little bit. 

Um, so we're not going to the clients we have 46 tab, you know, design? 

I think we can. 

I think we can Remove some of the junk that's in there to unnecessary stuff. 

Um, Can have access on friend and But, yeah, we'll kind of dress that up as well. 

Just that's kind of inscope in the current tickets, isn't it? 

No, no, there's no, mainly, I think we were just looking for us to look at the DNS portion for the private Link Ingress. 

Yeah, those are the top in that scripture, which is what I'm going to go through with not less. 

So, yeah, we need to maybe leave that and create. 

So, yeah, we need to maybe leave that and create Spreadsheets that Target specific things so that, we, You know, Do you have a few accounts at least is golden paths, whether that's something you want somebody else to deliver as a golden pad. 

All that you think Nimbus is uniquely placed is to deliver. 

Yeah, we'll continue to support gold paths As well as What was the other Sorry, Kevin, a little slow coming back from Libra was another Waving initiative that we are the VPC Consolidation. 

Still, some tickets out there for that as well. 

Yeah, but we we won't get revealed by doing that. 

Yeah, But if we can simplify it by, you know, any DVCs we've been cleaned up? 

Offices, I'm joking. 

That's a good technical decline. 

Actually, yeah, true. 

True. 

Like, wait, there's still, you know, 50 out there, that? 

Yeah, we can't get to the end, but we're closed enough to project. 

Either way, There's something to think about for. 

Go find it next year, So there is one ticket newly added On Christmas Eve to the backlog, which I've not seen before Face value. 

It looks like something the application team would do themselves, But um, Take feedback. 

It's on the screen right now. 

Yeah, that's right, Yeah, and needs to go back to the more, uh, craw PCI coordinate. 

Um, Send it over to. 

Or devops. 

I'll try over this. 

Um, pizza first Could be there from that little thing, Always standing in for creation at the moment. 

Um, I believe I knew. 

It's what happened. 

I didn't even know when Christian led Of Thanksgiving. 

That was a weird call, though, like, what can you guys done? 

I'm, like, Why you know what's what's driving this? 

Why do we need this, you know, done during the freeze? 

They're, like, Christian said, we got to get it done. 

You're good, just got here anymore.

I know you recently Completing his Cio Training, so maybe he's, uh, I'm not sure where he's going, but you'll be doing pretty good. 

But yeah, That was, like, I said, We'll see what happens with the I'm sure there's some reorg stuff coming around as well, as far as the, Um, That message or project icon, you guys pretty much know what I know I'm here in, like anything now Will be the actual. 

I think the ninth of this week or something. 

It's the last I heard, and that's a rumor. 

So I don't know, Uh, one of the freeze goes out further than that. 

Um, everything effort is be businesses as usual, um, no big changes, I think. 

Um, everything effort is be businesses as usual. 

Um, no big changes, I think, Um, you know, Um, as far as I know. 

Um, although you'll be the CI, our CTO, J, the report camp along with build Baldwin from the Mainframe, Um, Pretty much old. 

Garrett's team will be moving over, kind of like we previously did that. 

We move it over to, Um, all the And then I'll be. 

We've got pretty much everything I think for Haitian as far as the technical Resources. 

But we'll be the new Gary Or maybe fill even. 

I think the the night was what the day I, Well, we'll see. 

Yeah, they haven't formally communicated anything now, so I want to make that clear. 

You know, there's rumors. 

I think they put something some of them, that's stuff, and put something somewhere, I know. 

Yeah, Um, if? 

Yeah, Um, if you haven't know if you haven't looked out on the internet, everything's been passed approved by The U.S and and UK And Eu as well. 

So, There should be like stopping us moving forward.

It'll give you access Their network. 

Some of their system, I say, systems, their applications. 

And then. 

From there, I'm assuming I should. 

I got my credentials as well, but you should not log into this VPN when you are trying to create Well. 

The other thing is that by an issue, but I'm on the lamp in the UK office that it doesn't load the RSA page, so I'm going to go on the Wi-Fi because simply works on the Wi-Fi. 

What is the island browser? 

What is the island browser? 

It's an isolated browser Basically falls upon. 

Basically, eight hours are so open sandbox. 

So, are they making it where you kind of like log into a video to get access to your apps? 

Yeah, but surprise apologies.
