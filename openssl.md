🛠 Offline AWS CLI Upgrade Guide (Windows EC2 Private Instance)


---

📝 Pre-Requirements

✅ Access to any internet-connected machine (laptop, desktop, or bastion host)

✅ SCP/S3 or EBS volume method to transfer files to private EC2



---

🔖 Step 1 — Download the AWS CLI Installer (from outside)

1️⃣ On your laptop or any internet-connected host, download the latest AWS CLI v2 MSI installer:

https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

File size: ~60-70 MB

Save it as:

AWSCLIV2.msi



---

🔖 Step 2 — Transfer the installer to private EC2

Now you need to move this file to your EC2 inside private subnet.

Option A — Using S3 with VPC Endpoint (if available)

Upload AWSCLIV2.msi to an S3 bucket.

Use AWS CLI (existing version) on EC2 to download:


aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket-name/path/AWSCLIV2.msi C:\Temp\AWSCLIV2.msi

Option B — Using WinSCP/SCP via Bastion Host (if you have one)

Open WinSCP or PSCP, and copy AWSCLIV2.msi to EC2 directly.


Option C — Using EBS Volume Sneakernet

Attach a secondary EBS volume to your laptop (via EC2 workspace / volume service).

Copy file into volume.

Detach and re-attach this EBS to your target EC2.

Access volume from Windows Disk Management and copy installer locally.



---

🔖 Step 3 — Backup existing AWS CLI (optional, but good practice)

On EC2, backup the current AWS CLI installation just in case:


xcopy "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2" "D:\Backup\AWSCLIV2" /E /I


---

🔖 Step 4 — Install AWS CLI MSI (Offline)

1️⃣ Open PowerShell as Administrator

2️⃣ Run the installer:

msiexec.exe /i C:\Temp\AWSCLIV2.msi /quiet

✅ This will silently upgrade AWS CLI to latest version.


---

🔖 Step 5 — Verify the Installation

After installation finishes, verify:

aws --version

Expected output (example):

aws-cli/2.15.1 Python/3.11.9 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off

(Version may vary depending on the AWS CLI version you downloaded)


---

🔖 Step 6 — Check OpenSSL version (for assurance)

Since you’re targeting the OpenSSL vulnerability:

(Get-Item "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\libssl-3.dll").VersionInfo

OR (more advanced way)

strings "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\libssl-3.dll" | findstr OpenSSL

You should now see something like:

OpenSSL 3.0.14  (or higher)
