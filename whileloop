Sure, here are some key points on why you might want to upgrade from gp2 to gp3:

Cost Savings: gp3 volumes are generally cheaper than gp2, helping you save on storage costs.

Consistent Performance: gp3 offers a baseline of 3,000 IOPS regardless of volume size, providing more predictable performance.

Configurable IOPS and Throughput: You can independently set IOPS and throughput levels to match your workload requirements without adjusting the volume size.

Higher Throughput: gp3 can deliver up to 1,000 MB/s of throughput, beneficial for data-intensive applications.

Flexibility: gp3 allows you to scale performance independently from storage capacity, giving you more control over your storage setup.


Switching to gp3 can provide better performance, cost efficiency, and flexibility compared to gp2.
