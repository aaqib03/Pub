Hereâ€™s an enhanced version of your report with more technical language and structure improvements:


---

Transfer Service:

Terraform Module Enhancements: Primarily focused on the setup and client onboarding process, refactoring the Terraform projects for improved modularity and scalability. Specifically, worked on decoupling the V13 version of the Transfer Lambda module to support new use cases, including High Availability (HA) configurations.

Environment Segmentation: Successfully deployed the Transfer Service for the PROSA (scheme) across both UAT and PROD in the us-east-1 region, introducing a clear separation of resources between UAT and PROD environments.

Refactored Project Architecture: Refactored the Terraform project to facilitate efficient resource isolation between multiple projects, improving management and reducing potential cross-environment conflicts.

Client Integration Testing: Integrated the V13 Lambda module with the Transfer Service and conducted rigorous testing to ensure seamless performance and operational resilience.


Scheme:

Operational Improvements: Focused on management improvements, including documentation updates and workflow optimizations. Achieved significant progress in enhancing the backup and recovery procedures for Scheme EC2 instances.

CloudWatch Alarms Implementation: Deployed new CloudWatch alarms for comprehensive EC2 health checks across all regions and environments, ensuring proactive monitoring.

Incident Response Documentation: Enhanced the troubleshooting guides for recovery steps corresponding to each alert type, ensuring quick and reliable resolution of health issues. All recovery processes have been thoroughly documented in the internal knowledge base (DocPS).

Auto-Stop Timing Optimization: Refined the timing mechanism of the Scheme auto-stop feature, reducing execution delays during the end-of-month (EOM) batch processes.

Role Consolidation: Streamlined instance automation processes by combining roles for more efficient resource management, reducing overall overhead.
